10170_2	"The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans aren't as they should be.
From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time.
Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined? <br /><br />Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie.
In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought.
Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap opera-ish 70s made-for-TV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be.
The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good.
The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there.
The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable.
Donna Mills as a hit\man\""? Yeah, right! It's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen.
The movie also lacks any pace.
Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had.
With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made-for-TV movie.
The lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to.
The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.<br /><br />Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start.
So even though I've only rated Superdome a 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale."""
7031_2	"What made me track this movie down was the viewing Vampyres, I thought I have to get the other movies this guy (Larroz) has made, I was sorry I tracked this down,it is a weak attempt at an occult/satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex(with ugly actors and actresses, this is an excuse for sleaze.
The only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere, avoid this one, too much hype surrounds it, not worth the effort of finding it, this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition.
I hope he has some other movies which lives up to Vampyres, Oh and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that this is what carries the hype."
877_3	"I was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic \Private Lessons\"" which portrays the dream of any male teenager.<br /><br />\""Private Lessons II\"" has NOTHING to do with the title I mention.

There's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it.
I watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core flick.<br /><br />The women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie.
My advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable."""

Even though it's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin themselves, you don't get any good details into their personal lives.
It's mostly just them making stupid, jokey small talk and acting like white trash.
Look, I love Britney's music as much as the next babe, but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to Britney that they would watch her clip her toenails (yes, that could be an actual episode).
Thank God these two broke up, because they were PAINFULLY dull together.
This show is TOXIC!"""
1739_4	"Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do.
Someone over at 20th Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another.
Darryl F.
Zanuck should have known better.<br /><br />Betty plays a 19th century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.
Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed.<br /><br />Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated.
That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee.<br /><br />Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious.
Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate.
She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch in anything.<br /><br />Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song.
That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows.<br /><br />Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine.
I can't believe Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the lead here.
Neither will you if you see That Lady In Ermine."

Damn the reviews were so right.

10634_1	"Writer/Director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA.
He says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks.
The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film.<br /><br />Unfortunately Sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his \backstage\"" footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast (also on that reel) that was seen by millions, not hidden away in NASA vaults as he implies.
And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not faking footage.<br /><br />Finally, anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy Sibrel's hacked-up version of it.
(He shows you more of the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination than of his \""smoking gun\"".) Sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it.
What's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth, destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway Earth.
<br /><br />As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on innuendo, inexpert assumption, misleading commentary, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence."""
890_2	"I saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and I was straight up blown away by how bad it was.
<br /><br />First off, the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots.
There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, say, know the self-involved white people in love? I know it's not the love Crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness but you can't pretend to have a cinematic New York with out these fairly prevalent members of society.
Plus, you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that ham-handed Oscar, so where is everyone? <br /><br />Possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs? Me either).
This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst.
Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants.
<br /><br />But thank god they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson back together for that Jumper reunion.
And, side note, Uma dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks ravaged.
This, of course, is one thing in terms of his looks, but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor, lovely Maggie Q.<br /><br />I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire, but it has to be the Anton Yelchin/ Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste, which saddens me because I really like those two actors.
I don't consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt.
<br /><br />A close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie.
I don't mean opposite, I mean against.
Against is the only explanation.
I realize now that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight.
HIGHLIGHT.
Please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits, which seem to be a nod to the first New York Real World.
This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real idea of New York at all.
<br /><br />(The extra star is for the Cloris Leachman/ Eli Wallach sequence, as it is actually quite sweet, but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless, masturbatory torment.)"
8713_1	"Everything in this film is bad , the story , the acting , the effects but its funny , funny , funny !!!Scott Valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious ! The ''terrorists'' are as scary and realistic as the ''raptors'' , this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh .
The part where the giant T-REX who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending .If your into bad films , this is the pot of gold , the mona lisa of b-b-bad !!!"
1577_2	"This 1997 film-blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well-deserved legendary status as one of the screen's greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love.
The pervasive, ongoing and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and what's-her-name is sure to set many a viewer's heart a-flutter with memories of one's own first crush.
The brilliant screenplay dangles this embryonic affair-to-be in front of the enraptured audience, sitting transfixed as the abstract, almost-expressionist cinematography deep-focuses on the just-under-the-surface desires that ebb and flow between the principals.
You can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron.
<br /><br />A tiny drop of perspiration on the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine, and leaves no doubt as to its significance.
Scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again.
As with \Jane Eyre\"" and \""Rebecca\"" (to which this masterpiece is so often compared), the closeups of the actors' faces as they experience the slow dawning of the great love-that-is-not-to-be will haunt you forever.
<br /><br />The now-classic RC soundtrack score, with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer, emphasizes the emotion that drips throughout like a leaky crankcase.
<br /><br />If I had any criticisms at all by mentioning what I consider a minor flaw (and dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts), I would say that the hallmark of \""Runaway Car\"" - its sense of mounting sexual tension - is briefly broken by the highway scene, which now after repeated viewings seems just a bit overlong (and probably even unnecessary?) to the eternal, bittersweet tale of Love Interrupted.
<br /><br />Dare I advance what I perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this critically-acclaimed triumph of modern cinema? 'Citizen Kane' had its 'Rosebud' .
'Runaway Car' should have its catchword as well.
Perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme closeup of Judge Reinhold saying something such as \""A car is an extension of its owner!\"", and the rest of the storyline could then be dedicated to parsing every syllable, subtlety and nuance of that phrase.
Had that plot line been done, this film could have topped \""Titanic\"" at the Golden Globes that year, I'm convinced.<br /><br />My one regret? That I didn't read the novel first."""
10576_4	"I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005.
The premise was very simple and appealing: each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous, noteworthy horror director.
Then, when I finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown.
Some good episodes emerged from that first season, but all in all it was a mixed bag.
I attributed it to the learning curve, and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better.<br /><br />Boy, was I in for a shock.
At least season one had a few good stories here and there.
Season 2 (with the exception of \The Black Cat\"" starring the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and total loss to me.
The episode \""Sounds Like\"" may very well be the worst thing I have watched on TV in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes aren't much better.
I really hope that season 3 turns this around next year, but I'm not holding my breath."""
6619_1	"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema!! Could not wait for it to end.
To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even Babban getting killed was cut out!!! Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!! Amitabhs acting was great but that 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate can't even act.
Devgan was wasted!!<br /><br />I would not watch this for free again and I advise all others who read this to do just the same YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!"
8914_1	"I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that I was soon near tears over the $3.99 I had wasted at Blockbuster.
Joanna Pacula's acting and her awfully rendered Slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth.
I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many.
Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents.
While we're on the topic of talent, Breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe.
She clearly has not learned her craft.
In fact, she's really quite awful.
All the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their Sunday best.
Turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on.
Don't rent this terrible movie.
You will be sorry you spent your money."
2241_4	"I remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again, I wonder why.
I guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down.
Why oh why in so many English films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls? What is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the Confessions films but about a third of the way through (whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously.
Not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted.
In short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend.
Richard O'Sullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped but I reckon this to be one of his worst performances.
Just worth it for the ladies."

It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie.

10961_2	"Though the movie may have been \true\"" to Lewis's book (in that the script was basically word-for-word, verbatim), it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this.
The mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are *drawn* in, and as in the previous review, the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow.
I nearly laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth; I nearly cried when I heard the wolf's \""howl--\"" a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could.<br /><br />All of the acting is tremendously forced, especially that of little Lucy Penvensie...
I could only take so much indignation, desperation, and buck teeth in the (what felt like) fourteen hours of watching the movie.
The actress who plays the White Witch, in all her histrionics, seems that she'd be more at home on stage, where a booming voice, spread arms, and a valiant effort at something Shakespearian would be more than welcome.
<br /><br />The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors.
Indoors, it's as if BBC could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set, and so it is very small, and all the characters are constantly huddled together.
The White Witch's castle is a run-down, rotting countryside English castle filled with Styrofoam statues and bad lighting.
When the Penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually, *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles.
<br /><br />The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan, but you can bet that BBC probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline.
It looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking, but once it starts moving, you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit.
<br /><br />Yes, if you are a hardcore Narnia fan, you may want to see this version, simply because it preserves every word that Lewis ever wrote-- but Lewis was certainly no screenwriter, and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen.
During the scene in which the children are at the Beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves, Mrs.
Beaver's incessant, \""oh, just ONE more thing, dearies, and then we will be ready to go,\"" punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of \""NO, Mrs.
Beaver, PLEASE!\"" -- a scene of comic relief, so incongruous (they are supposed to be FLEEING from imminent danger, not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not), detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have.
In fact, the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these.
<br /><br />I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005).
The new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing all around, and a gorgeous and scene- stealing White Witch (who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician, as opposed to a shrieking banshee) captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting the least bit from Lewis's original vision (I think).
Lucy is a lot cuter (NO buck teeth, YAY!), as are the beavers (and realistically-sized), and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine, Desperately-Hungry-for-Acceptance-Insecure-and- Angsting-with-an-Inferiority-Complex Edmund that the new Disney version fronts.
<br /><br />Unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies, I would not recommend this film to anyone."""
2904_2	"If, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you don't realize that the main character, who writes a life advice column, is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself, then there is probably something wrong with you.
The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isn't) <br /><br />There's almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny.
It's hard to believe Binoche's character would have any interest in him.
Then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after.
Isn't that great America!"
7445_4	"Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place.
Coated in blaring, overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue, this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache.
The naffly-titled sequel, 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission, although there are at least one or two scenes that don't induce a coma."
1340_2	"96 minutes of this is cruel..and I love the old Munster's.
Yes, the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan.
There is so much 'intrigue' (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if it's an old Starsky & Hutch episode.
I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar.
Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60's (ludicrous) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors.
Why not let them grow and age? The addition of an Addam's Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party.<br /><br />Grandpa & Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a few hours (preposterous.) Sid Ceaser is the most, yes the most unbelievable character (I am including the bad robots) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler.
And yes, it looks like the laugh track is missing.
In fact, there are several spots where there is dead air, as if the laugh track was to be inserted later.
The actors seem to wait on the faux audience.
It's not laughable; it's sad.
Oh, and the best part! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were.
Marilyn says something like: \Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be? They could have been in an accident.
They could have been hit by a car...or a train!\"" Lily says responds with something like: \""You're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track.\"" What's amazing about this is: Yvonne DeCarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt.
He never recovered and this financially devastated her family.
(check out Biography's fantastic review of her life and career) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her.<br /><br />If you are a real fan of the Munster's then you'll have to RENT this mess.
It illustrates how some things are better left alone.
Even with the (nearly) original cast, this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago."""

If you have seen lot of films, this is a joke.
The acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly.
Not to mention, there are songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are stupidily performed.
New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the bollywood heros/heroines, you can predict whats going to happen next.
You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protray is terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies.
It suppose to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show.
There are times you wondering, you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them.
Are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid? There were only a few characters acting that was very good, but as far it is concerned with plot, action, it is poorly directed.

2361_1	"This movie is easily the worst of the series.
Though New Line might just be looking at sales, they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3D ending.
It wasn't that the 3-D was good either, because it was 50's 3D with the red and blue lenses(anaglyph.) It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like.
Beyond that this movie was so poorly done! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse directing.
This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a \Looney Tunes\"" episode.<br /><br />Seriously, not for horror audience, because it is corny and not scary, and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds.
Just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted.<br /><br />I remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten.

I'd gone to see \""Norman's Room\"" for that reason -- that movie offering Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and, also, Meryl Streep -- and had loved every minute of it.
Same for \""The Notebook\"" even though it was chick-flit lite.
And my feeling was, anything offering performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good.
Instead, I found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite, simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material.<br /><br />Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured.
I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story...so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse.
But while Vanessa's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt \""was a mistake\"" was riveting, at times, the part actually showing what that \""past mistake\"" was does nothing to clarify the matter.
In fact, it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest \""girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loses boy\"" fashion, and in the most unbelievable, clichéd, wrong-headed way possible.<br /><br />And from here be spoilers, so bear that in mind should you continue reading.<br /><br />First of all, Claire Danes was brutally miscast.
Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting.
Don't get me wrong, she can be good in the right role -- just not this one.
And Patrick Wilson was miscast, though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off.
He'd have been better suited to the part Hugh Dancy played -- the rich confused WASP -- and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all; he's a bit too WASP-y for that.
Hugh Dancy? One note -- \""I'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why.\"" And the \""why\"" (I'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died (as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties) so ludicrous, wrong-headed and mishandled, I nearly threw my candy at the screen.
<br /><br />As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister's \""perfect life,\"" her sister wondering if she's made the right choices, her pregnancy and her too-perfect boyfriend (which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach might have been a more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes) -- anyway, all this was hashed over in the 70's and 80's.
And in much greater depth.
Do we REALLY have to present it, again, and all as if it was fresh and momentous?<br /><br />And to top it off, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions.
She's still good, but only because she's Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup.<br /><br />So to put it simply, this movie has every cliché in the \""really meaningful message\"" movie book, and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out, again.
At two hours long and laced with \""Lifetime Movie-of-the-week\"" music that is guaranteed to rub you raw, it's a complete failure in both the \""meaningful\"" and \""moviemaking\"" aspects.
I give it \""3\"" only because of Meryl and Vanessa.<br /><br />Now, if all you require from your films is twadd le, then please set my comments about \""Evening\"" aside and have the time of your life.
But if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings, rent \""Norman's Room\"" and find out what truly great acting is."""
8812_3	"Unfortunately, the realism is boring.
This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes.
Where's Blade when you need him? While as dismal as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies.
While the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe Jeffery Dalmers hearts race a little faster, it wasn't nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS.
Really, I found it about as interesting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist.
If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to endure this, otherwise, for no one.
I was really surprised that this one wasn't made by the people at Brain Damage as that was the quality of Dead Creatures."
1534_1	"From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu \I'm so wooden I could be a Plank me\"" Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended).
The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist').
Wish I'd spent the £3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm....
Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut.
If you do buy this, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague.
If you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead.
However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta:The werewolf Hunt."""
798_1	"OK, the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale.
This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus.
First of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus.
An organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier.
Though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code.
Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the writer didn't think of that."
12464_2	"This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end, but it ended up more as a yawn.<br /><br />The writing was trite, the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring.
George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym, Matt Damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter.<br /><br />The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business, oil and the Middle-East.
I have seen documentaries provide more excitement.
Watch it only if there's absolutely nothing else to do."
2871_1	"I rented this horrible movie.
The worst think I have ever seen.
I believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job.
The worse film I have ever seen and I have seen some bad ones.
Nothing scary except I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much.
The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash.
The slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a B movied look like an Oscar candidate.
All I can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick.
I would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again"
8591_1	"I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck.
It finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films.
With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas' career.
He wants us to swallow the Annakin is Vader nonsense? I never believed it was true.
This film vindicates those feelings.
The story hasn't worked since Phantom Moron, and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade.
I have to go.
I know where some new rocks to throw are.
You want spoilers? Here they come.
Luke and Leia are NOT related.
Vader is NOT their Father.
Duke Countoo should have switched sides while he still could.
Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra.
His advice has never been any good to anybody.
Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films.
Annakin didn't build C3P0.
He found him in the desert and lied to his Mom about putting him together from scratch.
Chewbacca has fleas.
This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong.
If she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of Annie, but she had told do what George Lucas wrote for her.
What a dope!"
695_4	"I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see.
Well, I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as \April Fools Day\"", \""Friday 13th\"" and \""Prom Night\"", this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story.
Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer.
Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end.
As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed.
This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory."""
2845_4	"This movie down-shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd, grinding gears all the way to the sappy, b-movie finish-line.
The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie.
That is worth seeing.
The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast, you may miss it.
Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad-to-mediocre confusion.
There is no real conflict, and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character, Al.
I wonder if he's got a job for me in Cincinnati?"
1711_2	"Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun.
That's what it is, without the fun.
This film truly is mindless, it is absent of any plot or character development, or any sort of storyline.
The basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore.
Basically, every kill looks EXACTLY the same.
ZOmbies ripping someone apart.
Yeah, that's okay, but you need some original kills too.
I mean it got really lame, every kill looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way.
Thats what killed me.
I love gore, and the gore in this film did nothing for me.
It was just boring.
No storyline, just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person.
I wanted to like this movie, too.
I love shot on video gore movies...like Redneck Zombies.
But I couldn't kid myself.
This film has it's good points, but none of those are in the film.
I understand that many of the \zombies\"" helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world.
But overall, this is a terrible film."""
12166_1	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again.
She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills.
As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine.
But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original \Sleepaway Camp\"" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it.
This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it.
The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula.
There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical.
This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins).
As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins).
With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards.
There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore.
Skip it."""
11818_2	"On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk.
He releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship.
They dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star.
This massive craft is populated by only three people, presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors.
Anyway, to cut a long story short, the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies.<br /><br />The psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying.
'Annoying' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic - unhinged, frightening, dangerous maybe but not 'annoying' but he is.
The three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city! Considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man-made craft could exist, never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task.
Despite the vast size of the spaceship, the crew all have appallingly kitted out, tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs.
But there are a lot of corridors.<br /><br />The film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci-fi thriller.
But nothing great."
4405_2	"All I can say is, before watching the movie I did not have a hint indication who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what was her life story..and I have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data..
and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website; however, all I can say is that the actress Jeanette Hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status, as it is in real.<br /><br />After all , based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and Tehran as well as Afghanistan..
but believe me I am familiar with the area , it was all about an Arabic desert in morocco..
Turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic..<br /><br />I suppose for making a film like this- documentary type- a thorough research about all these minor elements is mandatory.."
2891_2	"I'm starting to write this review during a break as I watch the movie.
It's the first time I've tried doing that, but I'm having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks.
That's not because it's intense but because it's bad.<br /><br />It's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable, especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on screen being tragic and bitchy, self-indulgent and self-pitying.
This would have been a much better movie if they'd just left that character out of the story.<br /><br />He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very irritating melodrama.
Maybe somebody decided that if they couldn't make Ryan believable they'd just make him obnoxious.
The problem with that is: Who cares if a spoiled, whining, obnoxious jerk is dying? Not me.<br /><br />The ONLY thing this character has going for him is the fact that he's dying, and sorry, but that's just not enough.
Dying doesn't make anybody special.
We're ALL dying, sooner or later.
It doesn't give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk.<br /><br />The other two characters, and the actors playing them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are very much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pitying interruptions, would have made a much better movie.
But it's not over yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again.
Maybe something great happens before the end....<br /><br />Nope.
Sorry.
This rented turkey goes back tonight!"
5690_2	"First off...
I never considered myself an Uwe Boll Hater since I think I never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named \Seed\"" (which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about) I am close to joining the hate club.
This movie makes absolutely no sense at all...
the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90% of this movie is just plain boredom.
You can sum up this movie like this: <br /><br />1.
Hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on TV.
This is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of \""making a statement about humanity\"" and giving a Peta address.
Since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn-exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward.<br /><br />2.
Death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it.<br /><br />3.
Cops watch videos of animals, babies and women starved to death and decomposing in Seeds basement, having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because Seed is such an evil bad mofo.
Although the acting is OK the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions...
<br /><br />4.
Cops bust Seed in his house, act stupid and get slashed in the dark.
This sequence reminds me of a video game, you barely see anything except flashlights.
Seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed...
except for one who busts him.<br /><br />5.
Seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this \""movie\""...
he won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts.
Guess what...
they just bury him alive to solve the problem.<br /><br />6.
Seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on.<br /><br />7.
A woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it.
<br /><br />8.
Seed captures the cops family, lures him to his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter.
After killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats Seed wants (its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word ...
the movie has barely any dialog anyway so don't mind).<br /><br />9.
Boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where Seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3.<br /><br />This is it...
no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that Seed was burnt as a child.<br /><br />This movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value.
I hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment.
Its like watching August Underground ...
thats fine with me, some people will enjoy this brainless snuff.
But what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo-message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera-work, effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid.
<br /><br />So how does Boll get money to make such \""movies\"" when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets?? \""Seed\"" is not just the essence of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is flawed ...
lucky Uwe that the German taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments."""
10609_3	"OK I saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it's Unisol's best movie now plot Luc Devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner Maggie, who's been through countless hours of training and combat with him, to refine and perfect the UniSol program in an effort to make a new, stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated, intelligent, and agile.
All of the new Unisols, which are faster and stronger than their predecessors, are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called SETH, a Self-Evolving Thought Helix.
When SETH discovers that the Universal Soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts, he takes matters into his own \hands\"" to protect himself.
Killing those who try to shut off his power, and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers, led by the musclebound Romeo, SETH spares Deveraux, only because Deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut SETH down in a matter of hours.
With the help of a hacker named Squid, SETH takes human form.
Not only must Luc contend with ambitious reporter Erin, who won't leave his side, but Luc also must contend with General Radford, who wants to take extreme measures to stop SETH.
SETH has also kidnapped Luc's injured 13-year-old daughter Hillary, and is now holding her hostage.
Luc is the only person who can rescue Hillary, because Luc knows firsthand how a UniSol thinks, feels, and fights.
now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just-so-happened to be there and The soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when Vanne Damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when Luc is now human and Seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other Unisol and Luc can take a hit from him.
with the final fight when Luc smashes him to pieces I was really surprised that the pieces didn't melt and reform him (Terminator 2).
another thing that bugs me is how the hell does Vanne Damme get good actors to play relatives I mean in the case of Vanne Damme it's completely off the grid of how Science Fiction this movie is.
The Music Score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well Universal Soldier 2 is like that.
The good points are there's no Dolph (HOORAY) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many (I'm still haunted by the scenes in #1) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists (if you don't believe me look it up)"""
3793_3	"The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet.
It bears little resemblance to ETA Hoffman's original story on which it is based.<br /><br />In the ballet, the story is essentially over by the second-half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to watch a series of character dances.<br /><br />There's an infinite variety of stage productions that re-interpret the story in myriad ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto.
<br /><br />Balanchine's version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music).
The result is a completely forgettable first-half Christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing (the little that there is of it) isn't particularly memorable.<br /><br />The pantomime over-acting, particularly of Drosselmeier, which might look passable on the stage, just looks silly filmed for the big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things aren't much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II in the stage version).
Although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring.
This certainly isn't vintage Balanchine.<br /><br />Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets.
Watching this film version of his stage production of The Nutcracker has only re-affirmed this view."
1001_4	"I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments.
It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre.
Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief.
I'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/TV/literature/life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even).
Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully.
And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point.
It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay off."
218_4	"***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably.
Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical.
Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera.
Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br />Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all.
Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility.
And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning.
Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.<br /><br />Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent.
He has his character's attitude and it fits him.
Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie.
Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana.
I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room."

3266_1	"When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has run off with his own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his tale of woe--only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: the effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well, and numerous complications follow--including Ben's attempt to get Norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker (Tammy Dobson.
) Unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself.
<br /><br />Originally written for the theatre by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN...
IS THAT YOU? was an absolute disaster on the New York stage.
To give the play its due, I actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production--and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce, the cast played so broadly and in such drop-dead manner that it proved quite amusing.
It is a pity the cast of this film didn't do the same.<br /><br />This is an atrociously performed motion picture.
Red Foxx, one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century, is about as funny here as yesterday's wash, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the television series HILL STREET BLUES to much better effect) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; truth be told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson, and a cameo by Wayland Flowers have any spark--and sadly, that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast.
<br /><br />Not only is the film badly performed, it looks bad.
According to film lore, this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape, which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes--and believe me, it shows.
The film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment.<br /><br />Some films are so bad that they become funny, but NORMAN...
IS THAT YOU? isn't one of them.
I can sum up my reaction to this film in two words: miss it.
Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't touch it with a ten foot pole.
Just back away slowly and then run like hell.<br /><br />Gary F.

1166_2	"Having seen Versus previously I had high hopes for Alive.
The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising.
Alive did not deliver.
VERY slow development.
Loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals.
The premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up.
Could have done so much more at the end.
Most of the movie is just \ sitting around \"".
To put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end.
It really needed more shock elements.
If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment."""
9037_3	"You might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made-for from the beginning, since the credits list Susan Dey as \Special Guest Star.\"" Um, why would a one-off MOW like this have a guest star? Well, if you stick with it, you'll find yourself paying attention to little else but Ms.
Dey's butt, wiggling in a flowered bikini as the \""Partridge Family\"" house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes.
Susan's derrière is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo-disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene.
Sadly, Susie and her tush fight a losing battle: the jiggle-TV craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off, so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role.
In 1976 Fat Freddy Silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as Susan's audition tape for \""Charlie's Angels.\"" As is, our Susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber, neurotic women.
<br /><br />The view beyond Susan's heinie, it must be said, is not very compelling.
The scenery is nice, and photographed in a bizarre, hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera.
Nope.
It's just a typically suspense-challenged 70's made-for-TV thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash(and collect some cable residuals, though they obviously didn't know that at the time) and show off their \""range.
\"" Here we're treated to a TV-scale nuclear family, squaring off against TV-scale thugs who can't decide whether they're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult (thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies) and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television: don't mess with Dennis Weaver (see \""McCloud\"" and \""Duel\"").
The only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage-son character of Steve, played by the long-forgotten (if ever-remembered) Kristoffer Tabori, who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is (supposedly) menacing his family.
But Steve, as played by Tabori (gosh, why didn't we see more from this wunderkind?), is actually just grumpy and moody and isn't one bit conflicted when big D gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial (and literal) sand.

I am aware that the translation of book to movie isn't perfect but this movie was the worst ever.
The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it.
I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie.
This really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written.<br /><br />The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen even though I was skeptical at first about Mary-Louise Parker.

They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs.
That is the entire movie.

This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it.

588_2	"I am compelled to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to SAVE YOUR MONEY.
Almost any episode of Desmond Morris' \The Human Animal\"" or David Suzuki's \""The Nature of Things\"" could have bested the material presented.
Not only does the director fail to make use of IMAX's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen, everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously.
Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster, and their niece and nephew.
We follow them for an interminable forty-odd minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc.
Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the trans-Atlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this film at all cost.
If you do wish to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the beautifully photographed \""India: Kingdom of the Tiger\"" or the technically thrilling \""Space Station 3D\"".

I loaned this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how Arthur's nude scene turned him gay.

7780_3	"I could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd, but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe *something* would happen.
This is the work of a writer/producer/director/special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie.
That's what he wanted, anyway.
What it turns out to be is a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in it...
even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!) <br /><br />This is just nonsensical stuff, but I suppose it's not too harmful; it's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi-interesting peek at Brazilian \culture\"" (which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of 'hey, this is NOT America!').
But whatever hope the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog.
It doesn't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the \""action\"" happens, it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal.
Usually I would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it's called...
nah.<br /><br />If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double-feature of this (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure to skip this one.

The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest.
About the only interesting thing was the sergeant's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one, and spray painted it black to appear as police issue.
I think this movie should have been entitled, \""Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?\"" Scenes were well done but putting them together I once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.<br /><br />Since I didn't finish watching it I'd say there is some merit to renting this film ...

9133_2	"This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD.<br /><br />Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers.
<br /><br />(Possible spoiler warning) <br /><br />The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic \caveman meets fluffball\"" yarn, where a \""charming\"" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs.
The premises that the script's \""wit\"" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950.
It also contains some frankly bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance.
<br /><br />I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it.
<br /><br />In one sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job.
Both features show to what amazing extent Willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country).
Impressive! <br /><br />Rating (and I _am_ a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10"""
1504_3	"I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western Genre, and I usually also like most of the cheaply made ones.
Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre.
The plots of Fidani's movies were usually very weak, and since his talent was quite limited, he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like \Django\"" of \""Sartana\"" to the titles.
I the particular case of \""Giù La Testa...
Hombre\"" of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone's \""Giù La Testa\"" (aka.
\""Duck You Sucker\"") and added 'Hombre'.
The movie can be found under various titles (\""Fistful Of Death\"", \""Western Story\""...), I personally bought it under the name \""Adios Companeros\"", which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast, \""Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari\"", which is also entitled \""Adios Companeros\"" in the German language version.
<br /><br />The plot is rather weak, it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell).<br /><br />The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is, kindly stated, not very convincing.
Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as 'Butch Cassidy'.
B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although he probably wasn't a very good actor, I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidani's movies (such as the rather crappy \""Django And Sartana...
Showdown in the West\"").<br /><br />There is one very funny and original thing about \""Giù La Testa...
Hombre\"" - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest.
Kinski is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this.
One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D'Amato did the cinematography.<br /><br />\""Giù La Testa...
Hombre\"" is a cheap, crappy film, but nevertheless, it has some funny moments.
Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest.

6560_4	"\Shadrach\"" was not my favorite type of movie.
I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par.
Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable.
I also did not believe that Paul's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home.
Their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable.
It seemed the Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated.
There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone.
Who was it? Her son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again.
It seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all.
There were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me.
The story concerning Shadrach was nice but I wasn't convinced that the Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed."""
3347_3	"I am not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren.
I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent.
That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent.
Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is, but many neglect to point out the positives.
<br /><br />Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad.
Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens? Aren't there any other kind of teens? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy? One genius nerd that nobody likes? One slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?).
And one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him.
Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color.
They don't say much but get shot at some point.
<br /><br />Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school.
Preferably with the writers inside.
The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse.
When the bad guys (and girl) finally hijack a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van making out.
They drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school's paint shop, but they never get around to re-painting the van.
By the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van.
They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score.
<br /><br />For some reason, they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours.
The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why go after them? <br /><br />Anyhow, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns, and they keep finding the teens (including a guy in a wheel chair) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss.
Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed.
For every time someone gets shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss.
The stunts are pretty bad.
<br /><br />I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $10 Million, and I am amazed.
When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher.
Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam.
It was a test to watch it, but I passed."

A great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best.<br /><br />The editing drags on, there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take, and the soundtrack is unimaginative.
So much more could have been done with this video movie.
I guess they ran out of time, or videotape.<br /><br />Hand-held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them."
4255_4	"the movie opens with a beautiful lady in a tattered white gown running through a stereotypical eastern european town.
we know she's being followed by something, because she keeps looking behind her.
and soon we see she's being chased by a mysterious man in a black trenchcoat.
then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her.
but look is that her reflection in the store window??? no its just her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately they both get it.<br /><br />after this brilliant and amazingly fun throwback to the old hammer films of the 60's and 70's (in the credits the twins are listed as the twins of evil, which of course is the name of the final instalment in hammer's karnstein trilogy), the plot pretty much dies.
<br /><br />What little plot there is involves dracula (who conveniently changes his appearance each time he is reborn, so the producer doesn't have to rehire the same dracula) coming to a morgue, the med students realizing he's undead and thinking....wow what an opportunity, maybe i'll just disregard all those movies that say that drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and use the vampire's blood to find a cure for our jerk friend's ailment.
obviously this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire.<br /><br />A new concept but pulled off excruciatingly badly.
The movie keeps setting up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them.<br /><br />For example the med students attempt to bring drac back to life by placing him in a bathtub filled with blood in a secluded run down country mansion.
The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film, but do we stay there? no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool.
sigh.
This movie has a real problem with \homages\"" as i mentioned before the opening scene is straight out of hammer, and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammer-like movie, but the movie rapidly switches gears and changes to a medical horror.<br /><br />The other problem is that they introduce so many characters it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them.
There are the med students and their wheelchair bound professor-type \""friend\"" the med students are all: arrogant, boring, money hungry, and stupid.
how they made it to med school at all amazes me, unless the med school had to meet its muscle bound hunk/big breast quota.
and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie.
hey i can respect that but it would be nice if they didn't set it up like the movie would be about him.
then you have random priests, cops, and science types.
so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten about until they need that person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that it becomes quickly tedious.<br /><br />Basically this is a lazy movie.
no real scares, just a few predictable jump scares.
The set up for these is so elaborate it is hilarious.
for examp le the bathtub full of blood.
it is so obvious that drac is going to pop out of the murky blood.
and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable jump scare.
after this he kills one of the dumber and larger breasted med students.
we all know she's going to become one of the undead.
but what do the others do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house.
sigh, so you know who will jump out at you when the cops show up at the house..........<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />Maybe someone will get the hint that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmospheric, and then we will end up with an entire movie that is as good as the opening scene.<br /><br />"""
801_4	"Despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright; much better than I expected it to be.
I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me.
But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).<br /><br />The cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously.
I couldn't help thinking, though, that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like.
Maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.<br /><br />While it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard, 'Fatal Error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end."

They had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect.
Well maybe I had my hopes up a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweetish to a point that I actually left I had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade."

The tomatoes aren't the same, jokes are lame, even the actors aren't as funny.

He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story.
The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you.
Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful.
Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be.
None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic."

Chaos ensues.<br /><br />This feature length comedy - an OK entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L&H and producer Hal Roach.
Episodic in structure, the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after The Boys are taken hostage by villainous Cramer (who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is!).
The gags are OK, but inspiration is lacking, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-turned-director Gordon Douglas, previously responsible for Ollie's first solo effort in the sound era (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz.
Fair, but nothing special.
L&H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances."
8228_1	The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy.
Maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a seizure or something.
There is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie.
There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something.
It was disgusting.
Then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll.
I also didn't like when all her friends were being shot (or not I don't know)and she goes in the van and puts band aids on.
That was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie.
How much gas can a person siphon to get a van going? It must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie.
It was a terrible movie and I would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life.

Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree.
There is no emotion in this film.
The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message.

11689_2	"I have never seen any of Spike Lee's prior films, as their trailers never caught my interest.
I have seen, and admire Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster's work, and have several of their DVDs.
I was, however, entirely disappointed with this movie.
If this film is any indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to \get a job\"", and stop wasting the time and talent of others.
<br /><br />I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I'd seen.
I can only assume, from their sappy lovelorn reviews, that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work.
I only paid $2.50, in a \""Second Run\"" theater, and still felt I'd wasted my money.<br /><br />The IMDb \""Trivia\"" page says it all.......<br /><br />* \""Shot in 39 days\"" -- How can you expect to shoot a big budget \""Blockbuster\"", (as the media hype promised), in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all.
<br /><br />* \""Ron Howard was first going to direct the film...\"" -- He may have done this project some justice, given more time to do so, of course.
Though the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits.
<br /><br />OK! maybe not.
I'm sorry! This film was so rife with pitiful cliché's, implausible scenes, and lousy characterizations, that maybe even he couldn't have made much of it.
(Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell...Good call!) <br /><br />* \""Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks.\"" -- And it showed! Her portrayal of a \""Fixer\"", who makes people's problems go away, was as unbelievable as the script she was given.
Did she even want to be there?<br /><br />Other Peeves: <br /><br />* How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door, and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank, and he'd better keep away...or else? 
<br /><br />* When \""Detective Frazier\"", (Denzel Washington), comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have \""led\"" a cop, (much less \""let\"" a cop) back out to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /><br />* Det.
Frazier later claimed, to have given the robber \""every reason to shoot me.\"" Why, then, in their brief struggle, didn't he even try to expose the robber's face? That may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification.
And why did it take \""Steve, Stevie, Steve-O\"", (the robber's accomplice), so long to come and help out? <br /><br />* I understand that these weren't your typical bank robbers.
They had a different agenda, and didn't want anyone harmed.
But the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn't.
To them it was a desperate situation.
Why then, when two of the bad guys stepped outside to \""pick up the pizzas?\"", were they not taken down.
(first of all, how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lee's version of NY City, or SNL's?).
Taking them down would have reduced the bad guy's numbers, screwed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up.
If not, there at least would be fewer bad guys inside.
(Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!)<br /><br />* What police department in this country, would have allowed Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), to just waltz right into the bank, and discuss a matter with the robbers, that she would not disclose to them first? She had no authority, no governmental credentials; and besides,
 this was after all, \""already\"" a hostage situation...add one more?<br /><br />* Why wouldn't the Bank CEO, (Christopher Plummer), just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds, he could have sold.
 <br /><br />* Who was that \""schmuck\"", (the character, not the actor), with the Jersey accent, that, conveniently, volunteered, and said he knew the recording was \""100% Albanian\"", but yet he himself couldn't speak it.....SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his Ex-wife! What a \""schlump\"" she was!!! Both were totally unbelievable.
<br /><br />* When interrogating suspects, why did Det.
Frazier, continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist?, (i.e.
- telling the elderly woman she could go, and then she couldn't, then could; then couldn't?) Give me a break! <br /><br />* Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites, couldn't deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? 
<br /><br />* Near the end of the movie, a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid out for \""a week\""....where did the materials come from? (the drywall & studs).
It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer, so he could relieve himself.
The bank employees hadn't complained about the smell, all week long? Hello!<br /><br />* After such a debacle; since the documents \""had\"" fallen into the robber's hands, what kind of \""references\"" was Ms.

4595_2	Suffice it to say that this substandard B has nothing to save it - not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor.
Josh Leonard of Blair Witch fame does little to help matters.
Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store.
675_3	"City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to her family's rural digs, only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways? Radiation thriller,
 with barely a nod to ecology, has small town residents going berserk, which (laughably) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench.
The picture is too silly for words, wasting Tilly's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of.
Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage), though he is let down by the scrappy editing--and a fairly bathetic finale.
Simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve.
*1/2 from ****"
4800_3	"If you made a genre flick in the late 80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison (sadly, we never got an underwater prison flick).
Framed for murder by mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right alongside the mob boss' brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.).
But this is the least of Derek's problems as rogue government agent (and mob stoolie) Col.
Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus.
This is the only flick Saxon directed during his storied career.
For a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap-o Italian ones.
Sure, it is low budget, but that can't excuse the stilted staging, shooting gaffes, or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes.
To his credit, Saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist).
Cole, who looks like a more rugged Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the cliché mob boss.
The end takes place at Marty McKee's favorite location, Bronson Canyon.
Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE."
5032_4	"This movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for Christmas.
It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie, and like that movie, has scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason.
One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there's a Cold War tension portrayed between America and Russia.
Like in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world, paying close attention to Tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites it.
All in all, this is an okay movie.
Some of the scenes involving Gamera, particularly the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time.
If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you'll really get a kick out of this one.
I give it a 4 out of 10.
Had this been the unedited Japanese version that I watched, it probably would've gotten a 5."
8705_1	This movie is the worst movie i have ever seen...
it is humorous how bad it is..
the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing..(i've seen porno's with a better plot) When the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away.
But as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it ..
i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on TV watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean.
I couldn't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
1564_3	"...was so that I could, in good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is.
I barely made it through twenty minutes before I started thinking to myself,\Wow, this is pretty bad.\"".
And, to be honest, I would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for Esai Morales (though he had very little screen time).
He's the movie's only well-acted role, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows...or at least I thought I did.<br /><br />While watching this I started thinking back to his part in \""Shawshank Redemption\"" and realized it wasn't as good as I thought it was.
Problem: his jail-house/tough guy act seems like it's just that, an act; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression.
Has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was SUPPOSED to? I doubt it, but maybe he should have.<br /><br />And, to make matters worse, they've managed to inject a little jail-house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived, especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a \
""rasta\"" who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally slam a movie like this, but when I saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review.
I felt like I was cheated and lied to, and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie.<br /><br />I say BOOOOOOOO."""
2373_3	"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St.
series.
However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression.
From what I do recall, some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic.
Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension.
But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.<br /><br />An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise.
The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.<br /><br />Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter.
I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe.
It's like Englund's crying out \we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?\"" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight.
Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few \""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars\"" and that's it.
If this was the only Elm St.
film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all.
Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie.
overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.<br /><br />Acting is almost universally poor.
Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language.
Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity.
And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire.
The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit.
Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written \""you're f**ked\"".
When prompted for the map, Carlos responds \""well the map says we're f**ked\"".
Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified.
Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect.
\""Nice hearing from you, Carlos\"", quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along.
It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world.
Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.<br /><br />The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series.
Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with \""shut the f**k up, man\"" and a kick in the scallops.
And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead.
No laughs.
No scares.
No interest.
No fun.<br /><br />"""
9283_3	"I don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this Showtime original film bastardized beyond belief, but even if I wasn't, the poor acting, VERY poor casting (Sean Astin as the brilliant, athletic, and all around individual, Harrison?? The guy's completely generic!) and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable.
Someone pointed out how cute that Maculay Culkin line was.
If you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance (sadly, it probably was the most INTENTIONALLY funny part of the movie), maybe you'll like this movie.
But if you're a Vonnegut fan or not completely insane, don't see it.
Please."
10573_3	"I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school.
As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new.
Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through.
It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original.
We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him, we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust, then we have the father who is always gone.
Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does.
On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling.
Everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl, they get together, have sex and then boom we have a little kid.
Perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved I've seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted.
So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno.
So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message.
Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity.
I really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential."
3297_1	"Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood isn't making the money it used to.
Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage.
The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL' boys come out on top.
It wasn't Gone with the Wind but it was fun.
This movie is garbage! Hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$.
I only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make.
The only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee.
The audience is the victim.<br /><br />Don't see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead.
They still hold up 20 years later."
1336_3	"This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best movies.
I really didn't like it, and I was kind of disappointed in that movie.
For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast.
In some parts, it got so boring that I had to fast forward it.
It didn't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies."
4165_2	"I'm a big fan of camp, but when every plot 'twist' is predictable and bad, while obviously not trying to be, even I lose interest.
I was going to rate this a 3, but the ending dropped it a point easily.
Its only saving grace is that I hated other movies more.
Not enough beer in the world for this one."
8065_3	"Steve Carpenter cannot make horror movies.
First of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie.
The only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
This movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie), no action, no acting, and no suspense(also a key ingredient).
Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad.
There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience.
I thought that this movie was rated R, and I didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to PG-13.
Anyway, see this movie if you liked I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.
That's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary.
And seriously, this is to you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies.
This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
2644_1	"The Sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days.
I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public.<br /><br />A plot about a Secret Service Agent planning to assassinate the Prez could well be entertaining.
If handled by a good director or caring cast that is.
Douglas is the one who is framed.
Basinger is the First Lady, with whom he is having an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved plot contrivance).
Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't.
And Longoria is nothing.
A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and...that's it.
I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service.
As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a token and is very badly written.<br /><br />Clark Johnson's, he who gave us the equally as pathetic SWAT back in 2003, mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV-movie.
Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar.
Eva Longoria, the most over-exposed woman of the 21st Century, is basically only in this to attract to the Desperate Housewives audience.
Her role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development.
She barely has 2 lines to rub together.
A truly shameless marketing ploy.<br /><br />If you're a glutton for punishment then don't let me stop you.
But it IS time and money you won't be getting back."

10434_3	"Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1 + 2? God was behind everything? What has God got to do with Sci-Fi? God is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something.
In fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head, etc.
so they explain it with \angels\"" or just don't explain it at all.<br /><br />The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through.
For example, why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl (Hera), particularly after Adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue? Because they found out the location of the Cylon base? That's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives.
And how did Anders know the location? And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war? It's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.<br /><br />The people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series.
Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread 'The Word'.
Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is: don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).<br /><br />Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no \""force\""...
instead, a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus.
Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks.

4987_1	"This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion.
Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it.
What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny.
The actress replacing Jean Reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married.
Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film.
The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions.
This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well.
This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'.
No script since it was apparently written and added to daily.
No attention to camera or shots in mind.
Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so.
This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101.
How this pile got through no one can tell.
It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries.

11489_3	"In the U.S., very few films have been made about Rome that were not set in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter.
Hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it).<br /><br />It's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic.
<br /><br />However, this is not a historical film; it's peplum, and while the production values aren't rock bottom, the acting and characterizations are cardboard.
I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with wooden English dubbing it's very campy.
I got a few good laughs out of it at first.<br /><br />I haven't seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the Hercules movies of the 60s.
It's amusing up to a point, but as the film goes on, it gets somewhat boring.<br /><br />One thing's for sure: if I'd seen this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it.
At that age, I went for anything with Romans and swordfights in it.

<br /><br />i do have a problem with such productions; yet another attempt (just like \untraceable\"") of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights( how interesting that it comes at a moment when IPS providers trying to \""preferentiate\"" = CENSOR information,
 and the Americans and Canadians are fighting AGAINST that at this very moments).
this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil ( that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net), but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole.
SEEMS LIKE FEAR PROMOTION IS HOLLYWOOD'S NORM THIS DAYS, especially when coming to thrillers which is the most \""on demand\"" motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so = most viewed, best way to try influence the society as a whole.
such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and \""ethical\"" people, that it gives a new much needed meaning to \""anti-heroes\"" figures.
make no mistake , this is NOT \""DEXTER\"" which was meant to be high-quality entertainment.STOP SELLING \""FEAR\"" please, the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it.<br /><br />the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an Erroll Babbage that is CLEARLLY suffering of sexual frustration.
the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist(for sure a \""cliche\"" at least) ( in real life someone would probably get a beating for it, you will see what i mean).
the second scene ( with Claire Danes's character present) is even more extreme.
at that point i realized, in my opinion that Erroll Babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him.how many people, that have seen or will see this movie, have never been \""hold down\""(regarding BOTH sexes) out of self, COMMON gratification!?.typically the movie gives an extreme CRIMINAL case(that unfortunately did, is and will likely happen again sometime , somewhere) BUT fingers everyone else indirectly as well as \""you could become that\"", etc.
anyone that is familiar with Sigmund Freud and Jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone \""asses\"" , by such fanatical \""hero\"" here.
SAFE sex in its many forms IS healthy and not some evil that apparently Richard Gere character is obsessed with , on his way for some sexual \""crusade\"".
have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys!? or for how long an American teenager can see extreme violence on \""pg-13\"" but he can not even see a woman breast until \""R-18\""!?!?( yet the industry targets them with this VERY SAME sexual perversions like \""american pie\"" series for example).
raise the kids tester-one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to UNhealthy EXTREMES!? all sexual activities(upon MUTUAL acceptance) integrates individuals better then some \""rightous\"" nut-case, THAT blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on \
""the lives of others\""( a new German movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject).here, like in that movie, you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been.
<br /><br />i am very disappointed with Richard Gere especially after the recent \"" hunting party\"", a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic \""hero\""( after real facts as well).
but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone's political and social agenda.
\""the flock\"" and \""untraceable\"" 2 heads of the same hidden beast)))it just reminds you, if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a WHOLE, as Erroll Babbage has those here, to stay clear of them for THEIR own safety.they would kill my family faster then any 0.00001 chances of Paul Jerrod in anyone's life would...
<br /><br />in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about MY \""assesment\"" of this particular movie ( and \""untraceable\"" actually), so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did.
nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the \""foot\"".))))for once i agree with the rating, this is not a feature for teenagers or kids; simply because at best would confuse them even more then the \""common\"" belief of \""money+fame+fashion\"" and how that relates to sexuality.
\""scream\"" series and movies as such AT LEAST have a defined entertainment value(even if a dumb one in my opinion).

784_3	"Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family.
She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins.<br /><br />In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu.<br /><br />But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it.
Semra Turan, the \actress\"" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act.
Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director.
The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot.
Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.<br /><br />Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring.
The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting.
Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet.
<br /><br />The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European.
It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not.
It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which are, by the way, not really convincing.<br /><br />Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story."""
11394_1	"Oh, for crying out loud, this has got to be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless, twitty piece of Stupidity.
Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message, albeit on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so (and that's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back again, thank you very much!!).
It's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually I've known better fourteen-year-olds...), except maybe for Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough.
Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief.
I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least, the characters in Rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this \Serendipitous\"" mess.
It's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives, and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate.
How utterly tiresome.
I'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences.
After all, here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives (namely their respective fiancées), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there.<br /><br />"""

10437_4	"Admirably odd, though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome.
Robert Altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight.
Some of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as Bud Cort's vision of a \mother bird\"" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her!).
In the lead, Bud Cort is--once again, after \""Harold & Maude\""--a true original; not off-putting like, say, Michael J.
Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and inoffensive, a tough act to pull off.
Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's misfires.
He can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else, but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward.

6213_1	"This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies.
Horrible.
<br /><br />There wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another.
There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another.
I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /><br />Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix.
<br /><br />Examples<br /><br />>The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader.
<br /><br />>The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings.
(Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????<br /><br />>And the whole machine vs.
humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator.....<br /><br />There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? <br /><br />There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion.
The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either.
<br /><br />Just awful.
A real disappointment to say the least.
Save your money."
9787_3	"...
but the trouble of this production is that it's very far from a good musical.<br /><br />Granted, one can't always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty.
It's deadly dull and uninventive (with one or two exceptions) and just after I watched it I couldn't recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole Another Hundred People from three listenings.<br /><br />It is also strangely un-theatrical.
It takes place on an incredibly large stage (one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and does absolutely nothing with it.
When there's supposed to be one person singing on-stage, that's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty.
For me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />The fact remains, Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these no-talents can ever come close to.
And I'm puzzled by the popularity of this would-be-legendary musical."
2507_2	"This is not a good movie.
It's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where.
Not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away.
Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee she can't sing.
But who cares, she's sooooo damn good looking.
But I digress, nothing new here.
Bottom-line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens.
Surprise, surprise.
Welcome to the music business.
I can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie.
So many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading Black Movies.
I don't play that! If you want to support these films by going to see them - great! If you enjoyed it - super! To each his own.
But don't try to tell me it was good.
Pleeeease! I wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors.
Wanna see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones.
Ray.
Or The Color Purple.
Those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin.
Why? Because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater.
Just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film.
It's only good -- when it's good.

53_3	"I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm...
not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed.
Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing.
(For the most part, that is...
Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well...
minor detail.
Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age.
Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients.
I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*.
Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess.
Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood.
The reviewer who called it a \potboiler\"" is quite on track.
If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable.
To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters.
As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between \""Brother Sun, Sister Moon\"" and \""Pulp Fiction.\"" If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy.
I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it."""
11261_4	"To start with, I have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour.
Yeah, some things happen, but you don't know why or what for.
When you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons...
The characters are rather poor and the actors (specially the young ones) don't help that much to make'em look credible.
Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she's a superb actress, no matter if the movie is pure rubbish.<br /><br />The only positive things to say about \Frío Sol De Invierno\"" is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense...
Well, maybe the next time...<br /><br />*My rate: 4/10"""
9768_2	"When I first popped in Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the film was.
I was amazed at the length.
Both animated and horror films share a common ground: attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes.
Anything more, and you'll lose the bulk of your audience.<br /><br />This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me.
I'd like to say half of this movie could've been edited out, but I would be too generous to say that.
Go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could've been edited, even without being a film major.<br /><br />Regardless of the overstayed visit, the movie was below mediocre.
It spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the \elite 10\"" is killing off the remaining friends.
For the most part, they not only over-do it, but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say \""It's this guy! No! It's this gal!\"" You'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie.
And don't get me started on the acting.<br /><br />Okay, that got me started.
I had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character that went blind on Little House on the Prairie (later, research proved my suspicions correct) because all the way through this movie, she genuinely looked blind.
Strange, as an established actress, she should've been the best of the group, but turned out the worst.
The rest of the staff, aside from Ann (Bregman) was pretty damn bad, too, but she, uh, took the cake.<br /><br />The movie begins with a group of ten friends, and one's immediately killed off.
Barely anyone thinks twice of this \""dear\"" friend's disappearance, so they continue on their merry way.
Slowly, then more rapidly, there are revelations about Virginia's (Anderson), the main character, past and her psychologist, who's a tad bit more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most shrinks.
All the while, more and more deaths occur.<br /><br />What's funny is, just as the first \""disappearance,\"" the more \""best buds\"" vanish, the less the rest care.
Sure, they give a few seconds of air time to say \""Wow, (that person) just wouldn't run off\"" etc, but then they're back to their sexual ways.
And speaking of which, it's probably due to the horrid script, or maybe it was I who was losing interest at minute 30, but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the MAX by another and best friends the next scene.
SEE: the creepy guy that kept a mouse/rat in his pocket  literally  and was the most obvious suspect.
I'm giving the film too much credit (and time,) but how he became part of the \""elite 10\"" I'll never know.<br /><br />But, I digress, there's a mystery here.
Why are these kids targets? Why is Virginia thinking she's killed someone, when it was never proved ('till the end) that any of them actually has been slaughtered? And why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be \""Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see\""? Hell, even for 1981, most of these had been shown in any of the first two Friday the 13th films  coincidentally enough, Friday the 13th Part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of Happy Birthday to Me.
Perhaps, they're speaking of when they filmed it months prior, but were late to the, well, party.<br /><br />When the \""secrets\"" are revealed, trust me, you'll have to rewind 3-4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives, and even then, put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim/killer's words.
Even if you get the first time, it's an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale.
It's almost worth watching the whole movie again, but as a drinking game.<br /><br />This birthday gathering should be avoided.
It's a horrible and illogical first draft script  please, please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role, it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it's 100% unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />Side Note: When I was a kid, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror films.
(Still do, oddly.
Definite guilty pleasures, but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass.) We got our first VCR, and I taped as many horror films off network (or, EDITED VERSIONS) TV.
All I remember of Happy Birthday to Me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape, which scared me to death  and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was.
Even though I have seen other clips of this movie, I think this is the first full-length viewing I've had.
Thankfully, this awful movie didn't wound me as a child.
I am older now, and I can take this trash.
But never again.<br /><br />Side Note 2: That said, that crazy \""Happy Birthday to Me\"" song played in the end credits (and as a score throughout) still creeps me out tremendously.
I guess, this movie (or last few minutes,) did have an influence on my childhood.
Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!"""

I had it set to record all episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new things.
I probably could if I could get past Rachelle.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer.
It doesn't work for someone who's really interested in improving the planet.<br /><br />This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle.<br /><br />Since Ed is such a great font of information, maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea.

2756_3	"{rant start} I didn't want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill.
After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie \Gwoemul\"" (aka \""The Host\"") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic.
Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film \""Shiri/Swiri\"", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did? {rant end}<br /><br />The only \""reason\"" I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date, for the final scenes.
Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 \""Dragonheart\"", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons.
Remember \""Dungeons & Dragons\"" in 2000? Hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use, but how WELL you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.<br /><br />In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem \""Arirang\"" being played at the very end.
As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons)."""
6473_3	"As a child the first installment (\The Little Mermaid\"") was my favorite movie.
It was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family film.
A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time.
I believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn't surpass their original.
I think that I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I have grown up.
However, it is not a bad film.<br /><br />It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody.
Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eurselas' sister), so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea.
As Melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go.
Trouble stirs up as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out.
I did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing.

693_2	"((NB: Spoiler warning, such as it is!))<br /><br />First off, this is a teen slasher flick -- the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs piquantly put it.
If you're looking for Roshambo, this isn't it and wasn't going to BE it.
I'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly, this wasn't Zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever.
For what it is worth; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props.
Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role.
Another One Hit Wonder, except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(Then again, this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history.
Of the nineteen credited actors, a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film.
Three appeared in one other movie by the same producers.
Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits.
What was this, the Has Been And Never Were Mutual Aid Society?)<br /><br />Granted, I saw this a long time ago on late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with Joanne.<br /><br />2/10."

No likable characters, well, 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is.
I mean, they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing? why is he there?), that's quite scary I guess, but do I really care? No, I don't.
Why don't I? Because I don't have a clue who these people are and I don't know if I should want them to live or die.
It's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.<br /><br />This film lacks any meaning, any purpose.
It feels like I fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up.
It jumps right into the action.
Basically, some women and her friends get locked in the London Underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.<br /><br />Creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are OK, but that isn't what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.<br /><br />It's nothing new.
Another predictable modern 'horror', where Kate (the lead 'character') consistently does the stupid \""hey, I know you lot sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! I'm going to do the total opposite because I'm a dumb blond\"" thing.
I wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable.
In fact, I'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the, erm, grey alien-looking creature.<br /><br />\""Your journey terminates here\"" is the films tag line.
Well, Creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film.

I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film.

Plus it's focused too much on Christianity.
I know Freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons.

10389_4	"Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story set in Japan.
They had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976) etc.
Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way.<br /><br />The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide.
A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.<br /><br />No surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex (McClure) assuming the role of the wife's lover.<br /><br />Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion.
Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'The Omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky Susan George.
The first is a long 'Don't Look Now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter (probably at her insistence) entanglement with McClure, both looking pretty uncomfortable.
Anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost.<br /><br />Overall I can't decide whether 'The House where Evil Dwells' is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way.
If you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.<br /><br />BEST SCENE - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, Japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show.
They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup.
On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line \Ugh - there's an awful face in my soup\"".
If this wasn't enough the reply is \""C'mon, eat your soup for Daddy.\"" Laurel & Hardy rest in piece."""

I found the first two 'Demons' films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad.
It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the *** wife drove me mad, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film.
I turned it off about three quarters of the way through because I was very, very BORED! Don't bother."

Awww.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--Amazingly funny movieeven if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.<br /><br />--This and the sequel on one disk in the Wal-Mart $5.00 binso it's only a little overpriced.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br /><br />--The violence and gore are kind of sub-standard.
One person is stabbed with a corncob.<br /><br />--Sounds like they put some effort into the musicbut it doesn't really fit the movieand isn't all that good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--Terrible, terrible acting.<br /><br />--Another slasher let-down with sexy womennone of them removing clothing.
When did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??<br /><br />--Ridiculous story.<br /><br />--The scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush.<br /><br />--Standard underlying love story goes nowhere, and is poorly done.<br /><br />--Some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomyou never really know who anybody is and then they're killed.
And you only assume that they must've had it coming.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--Extremely average slasher fare, just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well, all that other crap.<br /><br />--Nowhere near as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even Angela from the \""Sleepaway Camp\"" seriesall of which are better than this atrocity.<br /><br />--The absolute worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE.

The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasibly good-looking, especially for this role he is given.
Also, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, rent Michael Crichton's \Disclosure\"".
At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90's.
<br /><br />Alexandra Paul, who is usually watchable, plays an embarrassing scene here.
There are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam.

9287_1	"WOW! Why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be.
HPD2 has no clue of what it wants to be.
It just exists on screen for reasons I cant explain.
Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch(played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried.
In the jail, a riot breaks out between rival inmates, one of them gets shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape.
During a conjugal visit, Twitch's fiancée and Burke's(played by Bill Goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by Cortez and are held in an execution room.
Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that Cortez has their loved ones.<br /><br />Opinion: This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return.
The script is terrible, the acting is horrendous, the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature.
Look, I know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do.
Nobody in this \movie\"" believes in the characters they play.
Nobody in this \""movie can be taken seriously as an actor.
Kurupt should be ashamed of himself.
His character \""Twitch\"" is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by Burke or the other inmates.
Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a PHD(pretty huge dump).
The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when action is happening! Don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent.
It stinks and is a prime reason why people despise Follywood."""
8527_2	"There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth.
This movie, \The Last Unicorn,\"" \""Flight of Dragons\"" and \""The Hobbit.\"" I own copies of both \""Dragons\"" and \""The Hobbit\"" (both excellent) and I hadn't seen \""The Last Unicorn\"" in more than a decade.
That was until today and now I wish I hadn't.
What bothered me the most was the script.
It was incredibly choppy and often inane.
Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation.
We're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! The story itself isn't that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent.
Not even close.
On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball.
This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day, but it just got cut.
I don't think I could ever sit through that crap fest again.

6873_1	"The TV productions at the 2000's start were between weak and bad.
Before marks like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) the TV didn't have the right hit yet, which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s' viewer.
Titles like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) weren't encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least weren't that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them.
(Special Unit 2) was no exception.
In fact it's Men in Black meets The X Files' spoof ! (As if these were the special unit 1).
But even according to this brilliant formula; it didn't work well.
It was promising; at the time there was some saturation out of the \supernatural\"" cases after a decade of many X files already, so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too (imagine Mulder as womanizer !).
However (Special Unit 2) wasn't the strongest in this, or a strong when it comes to make a comic Sci-Fi show.
It was highly ridiculous, where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one.
It enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly.
(Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian.
His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid.
Sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work.
It's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea.
Among (Evan Katz)'s other works as a co-writer and a co-producer like (Seven Days) before or (24) later this must be a low point !.
Despite the distinctive personality, it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time.
Therefore if that was there goal, so they made one of the silliest indeed ! And truly, it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only !"""
8113_4	"POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; GETTING POPEYE'S GOAT **1/2<br /><br />I used to lap these up as a kid but, catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back-to-back now i.e.
several years later (they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they don't hold up all that well! The character of Popeye isn't exactly sympathetic to begin with, Olive Oyl distinctly overbearing and Bluto's antics failed to elicit much interest either  in short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot.
They're strictly juvenile fare, yet I doubt today's kids would even have the patience to stick with them!; furthermore, the animation style is unattractive.<br /><br />Taking each short per se, I guess they improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were, so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief (hardly original, I know, but always an amusing ploy).
One interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with Popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience."

The villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor.<br /><br />This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation, that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated.
Anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the End of the World is not at all his pride!"
2085_1	"This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently.
When a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself I pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies.
The bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public.
From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting, how long its been since they got some, when their next sexual liaison will be, and with whom it should be with.
On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes.
This could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here.

I'm an open minded guy after all and I’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks.
As the end credits rolled on this one I searched for meaning and something nice to say.
Here goes: \This film was mercifully short.\"" That's all I got.<br /><br />Okay, Okay.
The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits.
I did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.<br /><br />By the time of the \""chicken dance\"" at the finale I had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall.
I don't know what could have salvaged this film.
The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts.
Maybe I should have sparked a doobie or drank a LOT of beer to get the full experience of the film.
Either way, I'm not watching this film again unless I'm really depressed.

6490_1	"Okay...so i've seen a lot of really odd/unusual movies in my day.
Fear and loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think of that.
Well not anymore...from here on out, whenever someone asks me, \hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?\"" Slipstream is what i'll say! And I do not mean \""unusual\"" in a good way.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the movie, it was obvious that this was going to be one of those \""trippy camera effect\"" movies.
By that I mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and fast-forwarding people's words and scenes, messing with the color on the screen, flash forwards and flash backs constantly...then you have the actual acting itself.
People randomly get violent, shoot things/people, say the weirdest things that just don't make much, if any sense.<br /><br />The movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he's writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see this \""trip\"" he goes on throughout the movie.
The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a real hard time even finishing Slipstream.
It kind of hurt my brain a bit.<br /><br />I can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia...blah, blah, blah.
Point is, this movie hurts your brain when you watch it....it makes very little sense, it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over...and you can say you actually sat through it! So in closing, if you want to see a movie that will have you saying \""what the heck\"" over and over again both out loud and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out.
<br /><br />Mr Hopkins, while I applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing....please, do not ever make a movie like this again.
Next time, try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache."""
3689_2	"The main aspect about the Superstar's movies at his later stages were the frequency, the lacuna between one movie and the next.
Being a well established star of the south Indian cinema, the feedbacks he was receiving before Baba was great.
<br /><br />Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of movies he acted in Tamil as a mass Hero in 11 years were only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year.
All of these were a great hit.
He was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down.
<br /><br />But after Padayappa (1999), he went into a state of Hibernation.
His fans all over the world, especially in South India were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action.
So, the Tamil cinema industry decided to come with Baba.
<br /><br />The movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with Superstar in it.
But this clearly did not work out in this movie.
As usual, the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit.
<br /><br />Rajinikanth's image was totally damaged.
The fans went nuts.
The movie's collection did not meet the expected level.
Reputation of great people went down.
<br /><br />The only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by A.R.Rehman.
Rehman is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc.
Well, i never thought that this movie would join that league.<br /><br />You'l feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad, it'l be because of the superstar's image going down.

1769_4	"1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans.
It's the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers(a shape-shifting feline-like, flesh eating, life needing, near extinct breed of humanoid) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive.
They come across as pretty normal upper-class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home, day and night.
Cats are deadly to them, so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down.
We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack(which is also a first in my movie-going experience) --- hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film.
The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a \sleepwalker\"" and then he just wants her body.
There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life, but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he'd just get over it and bring out the gore.
Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it's typical Stephen King downbeat ending.
The movie is interesting because King's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection, but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn't cut it."""

He is the worst out there.<br /><br />The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in.

Too bad it wasn't written well.
Casting Sidney Poitier as the FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job.
Tom Berenger, on the other hand, only knows one emotion in most of his movies, anger.
Kirstie Alley's character could have been a great one, and even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female.
This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be.
I don't care for Alley's acting anyway.
The movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did.
The director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action.
I will keep this in my collection only as an example of Poitier's performances."

Part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans.<br /><br />Shame on you, Otto Waalkes!<br /><br />The only slightly amusing moment in the film is Helge Schneider who apparently seems to be pis*ed about the other characters.
It's quite easy to identify with him...<br /><br />The screenplay is sloppy/non-existent.
The director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately.

8588_4	"Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series.
The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader.
And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right.
Not great.
Not even good.
But pretty all right.
This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels.
Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine.
But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times.
Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess.
I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed.
This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough.
I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle.
It was kind of boring.
I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better.
So said we all."
4746_4	"There are several things wrong with this movie- Brenda Song's character being one of them.
I do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- I honestly don't.
I believe she is given poor lines.
She is just supposed to be, \that vain, rich girl\"", and while it is funny in the TV shows she plays in, it can't even get a dry laugh from me here.<br /><br />Either way, I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this film.<br /><br />The movie was not that terrible...initially.
Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural.
I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight \""the great evil\"" and save the world? Which brings me to another point.
I know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in Chinese culture.
It seems like all of the \""warriors\"" in Wendy's family line were women.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that.
Sure, maybe they could've worked it in somehow, but they offered no explanation whatsoever.
By doing so, they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media.<br /><br />Nevermind that, however- let us continue.<br /><br />Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on.
Yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming- I mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? The problem is, when \""the evil\"" starts to manifest himself, Wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be.
She is extremely careless- even for someone like her.
She continues not to care about her training.
I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: \""If you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone.\"" Wendy: \""Whoa, talk about pressure.
Well...let's talk about something else.\"" Yes, let's Wendy.
Let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training.
Of course Shen lets her, but his character has an excuse.
Better that he cooperate with her, than that he not, and she not train at all, and get them both killed.<br /><br />Oh, speaking of which.
Shen also told Wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (I am assuming that part).<br /><br />This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable.<br /><br />As the script-writer would have it, Wendy's homecoming and this \""great battle\"" are on exactly the same day.
Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, (who Shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she \""felt weird fighting an old man\"") inform her that Shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.<br /><br />We initially see some half-decent fighting, that is actually entertaining.
Until finally, the great evil comes out of Wendy's rival-for-homecoming's body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.<br /><br />Don't ask.<br /><br />Anyway, Wendy gets all \""panicky.\"" Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.<br /><br />Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.
<br /><br />She screams title of said article out.<br /><br />Now...it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful far, far too fast.
No, I will not let it be excused because it was her \""destiny\"" and she had \""the power within\"" her.<br /><br />Since when, though, did she learn healing? No, worst...since when could she resurrect people? So Shen is raised from the dead.
Then, Wendy and he fight the guy.<br /><br />He loses way to easily.
The worst part, is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever.
Then the monks commend Wendy on her sacrifice.<br /><br />Two things, #1: Don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more \""finesse\"" to it? #2: What sacrifice? The fact that she didn't go to homecoming? Because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleed.
I mean, come on now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see somebody get hurt.<br /><br />Ah-hem...moving on.<br /><br />I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie a one, based on my comments.
Part of critique, you must know, though, is breaking a thing down.
You don't necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's there, you bring attention to it.
This movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.<br /><br />So, I suppose it was all right.
Not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching it."""
4580_1	"I'm still trying to decide if this is indeed, the worst film I have ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed, but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many BSers who populate this film.

8726_4	"First off I want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars I rated it.
I gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all.
However, \The Big Alligator River\"" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than your average nature strikes back movie.<br /><br />A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around.
Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god Kroona, a giant Alligator.
But the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too.<br /><br />This movie is a pretty well-done adventure/horror story with a good musical score and direction.
But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is obviously fake looking.
Some of the close-ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see.
Some of the underwater far-away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky-toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop.
But the natives are believable, if not authentic.<br /><br />Probably not the movie that will give you non-stop thrills, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention.
And like a lot of creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count.
It also has lots of good jungle scenery.
Acting is below par though, but who was expecting it to be better, eh? <br /><br />Much, much better than its recent American counterpart \""Primeival\"" but nothing to be compared with \""Jaws\"".

In my opinion PG13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why I already knew I was going to be bored throughout the entire film.
Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we all haven't already seen.
I guess I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening; it got old and repetitive.
I also didn't understand if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not.
There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred.
The movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about.

3555_1	"Years ago a movie going friend and I went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred John Cassavetes.
For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated for Oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat.
Up until seeing The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him.
Had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether.
But we did not walk out.
At the time, my friend and I jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made.
Now frankly, this is not true.
I have seen many poorly made films on Friday nights on Cinemax (did I just say that out loud?) that are far worse than The Incubus.
Almost any movie starring Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus.
Certainly Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus.
However, I have since consistently used The Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall.
When talking to this friend about a movie I may have seen I will always remark that it was better (or worse) than The Incubus.<br /><br />http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/"
785_2	"This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of \Hamlet\"" to ever reach the screen.
Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket, having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of \""Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"") when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of \""ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack\"" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford's Kate.
<br /><br />Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed.
And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.<br /><br />The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of Kenneth Branagh.
This is never so apparent as in the \""How All Occasions Inform Against Me\"" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's \""I'll never be hungry again.\"" This may serve Branagh's ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered \""Great Moments With Mr.
Hamlet.\"" Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword.
Branagh's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye.
The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.<br /><br />While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism.
The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control."""
9218_4	"The psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out.
Its often billed as an anti-RPG movie, but its really not that simple.
Here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what (if anything) they're trying to say about gaming.<br /><br />They laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction, all of them having parents who are divorced, alcoholic, and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they're harshly pressuring them to succeed.
Tom Hanks is arguably the worst off, having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead.
<br /><br />Its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives.
And sure enough, at the end, when they go to see Robbie (Hanks), they're all happy and well-adjusted, embarking on their adult careers, problems solved, games put away (Daniel doesn't even want to design computer games any more), and even Robbie's mother, who's been constantly drunk and dissatisfied, is suddenly the Happy Homemaker, looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers.
<br /><br />Sure, JJ suddenly (and quite cheerfully it seems) decides to commit suicide, but the reason seems to be entirely because he's a lonely boy genius who can't get a date, and not because his character dies, as in the famous Jack Chick tract (which happens afterward anyways, and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end Daniels game and get everyone to come play his.
In fact, the prospect of live-action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself!) And in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie, Kate, looking very fetching in chain mail, looks right at the camera and says something like, \The scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds.\"" <br /><br />The biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty, homeless-looking guy of his magic beans.
The recurring theme (a \""The Way We Were\"" for the 80s)might have been poignant at the end, but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place.
And for one final mystery, our hero, wearing full Pardu regalia, has a psychotic break, becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest, so of course the first thing he does is change into 20-century street clothes.
<br /><br />So maybe the movie's irrational, but I guess its dealing with an irrational topic.
In those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed, and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo-jumbo at you.
The anti-game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene, where the reporter asks the cop whats going on, the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there's a chance Mazes and Monsters is somehow involved.
The reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game (although he allows his own children to play it), then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation.
In the end, its no masterpiece, but interesting as made-for-TV movies go."""
4384_1	"The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, is beyond me.
This really must be one of the worst films, in addition to \Haunted Highway\"" I have ever seen.
BAD actors, and a really bad story.
There's no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even though it's Halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed, not to mention gutted, people with tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people I might add) and some person dressed up as Satan dragging dead people out of his house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person.
Not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus' appearances on the same day, like this kid does.
When i was 8, I sure had more brains than that.
<br /><br />But, the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute Satan look-alike as well, no questions asked.
The question throughout the film is, is it really Satan, or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it? Well, he's got human hands, arms, built and whatever, so I guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well, otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it.
Then, with this person being human and all, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!!???) cops (all with guns and training i presume), and a few other people.....and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him, or what?<br /><br />The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've seen, and I would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap."""
2637_1	"Seriously, I don't even know where to begin.
It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'.
The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ...
well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see.

6915_4	"This is one of those films that I remember being in the can for years before anything happening w/it.
I don't think it's terrible, but it's not really good either.
Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best.
The cast is pretty good in what they're given, but again you are only as good as the script.
Baldwin directing this although I could have sworn he didn't direct all of it, I thought I read somewhere or lots of re-shoots wasn't bad but he definitely has some potential in there.
Although his work on \30 Rock\"" is nothing short of genius & should keep him busy for a little while longer.
I just hope the show bows out gracefully a la Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long.
9 years it went.
So if you want to see a film that you won't get much from, but won't really hate either well this is for you.
I can't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released & only on DVD at that.
It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen \""The Edge.\"" Now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment."""
1282_4	"Here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending.
Conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes.
It would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity.
The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life.
Brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of Gig Young playing a character named Gig Young.
Someone mentions \Gig Young\"" and then who appears but Gig Young, the actor! Worth seeing though far below what it could have been."""
7851_2	"As has been stated countless times, \The Hills Have Eyes 2\"" is NOT a remake of the (generally disregarded) mid-'80s sequel to Wes Craven's 1977 original.
But wishing to give this postmodern sequel-to-a-remake the official stamp of Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (a double threat alongside his son, Jonathan) has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality--in plain English, HORRIBLE.
Former music-video director Martin Weisz takes the reins from Alexandre Aja, and is clearly in way over his head--yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the Cravens' Screen writing 101 scrawl.
Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of goofball National Guards(wo)men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls (played without a lick of irony, mind you), but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren't funny.
After viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise, their fate against the repulsive, roaming cannibals is painfully obvious.
Only this time out--as in the original '80s sequel--the script is so simplistic (barely existent, actually) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks (we're treated to a combo childbirth-murder during the opening credits, plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't ejected the DVD by the midpoint!).
Even the mutants in this outing are personality-free freaks of no memorable stature--the tacky, rubbery-looking makeup FX seems, like the rest of the film, to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment.
I really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja's otherwise excellent film, and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of \""Hills 2,\"" setting the stage--VERY lamely setting the stage--for a third installment...yet the Cravens and Weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions work that they'd be hard-pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face."""
312_2	"If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it! If you haven't, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst.
So, if you're REALLY bored, go rent it.
If you want to know what it's like, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people.
Adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes.
BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is."
262_4	"Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian.
However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role.
Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).<br /><br />Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream.
Or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled."
5154_1	this is the only movie i have ever walked out on.
bad acting-- bad plot-- bad casting-- bad directing-- bad cinematography-- if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldn't have done a better job.
i hope they are proud of his turkey.
i'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood.
don't waste your time!
6284_4	"I liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem I quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody).
<br /><br />There is no real twist (which is fine) , but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either (how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror?).
<br /><br />Admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull."
10362_1	"Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60's ;like the book was.
And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption.....
I'm glad that, maybe, someone might be influenced to read the books.....
but, The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT? And what's up with the volcanic upheaval? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us!!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was European version of this film.
I sure wish I could id it.
I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption.
This movie needs to be X'd."
9216_3	"Hoo boy, this was a real trial to get through.
The DVD case has Tom Hanks' mug plastered on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it.
He looks about forty on the box, however, the movie was made in 1982, so he still has his Bosom Buddies 'do and of course is about forty pounds lighter.
The plot concerns a Dungeons and Dragons like game that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real.
Chris Makepeace is a boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats.
Ooh,look, he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo! Now he's dressed like a WWI pilot! This was a truly awful movie but in a bad way.
A bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids.
There's Anne (I'm Honey West, dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually looks kind of hot.
Murray Hamilton, the Mayor from Jaws, has a thankless roll as a cop.
Wendy Crewson, is the love interest for Hanks and some blonde guy I have never seen before or since.
There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement.
There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he's, you know, nuts.
The monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator fame.
A friend of mine got this out of the ol' discount bin at MallWart and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it, so naturally I had to see if it was as bad as all that.
It was.
The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit of a shock.
Do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin.
Oh yeah, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recuperate and is visited by his friends.
Hanks mother, a drunken Vera Miles, says he is coming along nicely now but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he is crazier than ever.
The End"
9003_1	"This movie really, i mean REALLY, sucks.
Its got plot holes so big, and 30 foot dragon can fit through them.
Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real.
I mean, when you see something like this, you gotta be thinking \Wow, someone actually made this movie.
Then released it.
That takes guts\"".
Whoever they are, i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore.<br /><br />When i hired this movie, it wasn't in on DVD, so i (reluctantly) took it out on video.
The first thing to appear, was a Lord of the Rings trailer, for the Two Towers.
This was a very clever move, putting this trailer on the video.
It justifies me (reluctantly) giving the film 1 star, otherwise i would have given it zero stars.
Maybe the producers though the star attraction of Dean Cain (I think thats how you spell it) would draw in the crowds (uh, to the video store that is).<br /><br />Next they employed split screen technique (like in Hulk) to (i assume) compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is.
On the box cover, we see a picture of our hero, and the dragon.
Does the dragon look exactly like the one in Dragonheart, or is it just me? Either way, the dragon in the film looks like a reject from Gremlins 2, and has the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain from the early 90's (perhaps worse).
Also, not the Dragons movement as it pursues its victims- its the same F##cking monotonous movement- right leg, left leg, right leg left leg- dom, dom, dom, dom DOM, DOM F#$king DOOOOOM! This just pisses me off.
Maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of Jaws.
Why not then have a Dragon POV shot.
Either way, that was just funny, much like watching a Weebl toon.<br /><br />Dean Cain gives many puzzled looks during the film (maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career).
Don't expect Superman here.
The first time i saw the trailer for this film, i thought it was an add for a PS2 game.<br /><br />As for the story, its so so bad, my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there.
Oh, and did i mention that I F@#KING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM?!!!"""
323_1	"This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else.
There was no plot and no point.
I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description.
Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure.
He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy."
10966_1	"A friend once told me that an art-house independent film ran in a cinema when- upon the closing of the film - audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats.
Of course, my imagination ran amok, trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work.
Well,now my imagination can be put to rest.<br /><br />I am a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work.
I have come across many people who thought Tarkovsky's films are slow-moving and inert.
Opinions being what they are, I found this not to be true of the late director's wonderful works, which are wrought with meaning, beautiful compositions, and complex philosophical questions.
Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called the heir to Tarkovsky, I was excited to experience his films.<br /><br />With the exception of the open air ride through the fields (Stalker), this movie has no kinship to anything Tarkovsky has done.
It does not seem to possess the slightest meaning, even on a completely mindless level.
It's supposedly \gorgeously stark\"" cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft.
There is a no balance, no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow.
The main character is so inept and indecisive, it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner.<br /><br />I am also not adverse to non-plots or story lines that progress on multiple non-linear fashion.
But there isn't even a non-story here.
One must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost, as hair-pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a Tarkosky time sculpture look as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short.<br /><br />I won't rule out that this may be one of Sokurov's stinkers (Tarkovsky's Solaris), but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky's heir-based on this film- would be to call Paris Hilton the successor to Aristotle.
C'mon guys, don't be afraid to say it.
No amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life.
I don't profess to fully understand Russian culture and I probably don't have Russian values, but I immediately picked up on Tarkovsky's work as something magical, a treasure and a gift to viewers.<br /><br />If it didn't have Sokurov's name on it, and it aired on say, Saturday Night Live, I'm pretty sure nobody would \""read\"" all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick."""
7487_1	"Unfortunately, this movie is so bad.
The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon.
For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again.
Even the audience I was with never laughed.
The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e.
The couple having sex in the park.
They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick.
The whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away.
Why isn't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie.
You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens).
I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's if you want to laugh."
4027_3	"This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history.
Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish, with only good/bad characters.
The world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc.
However, what I HATE most about this film is Bola's friend's father.
The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, this is like...
philosophy, or something).

Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie.
It does have one good message in it though, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER!!! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality.
That was very aggravating.
Even the make-up on the actors was completely bad.

I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.<br /><br />I was a youngster at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on.
The entire world followed the moon landings.
Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch.
Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a multitude of languages.
In school, some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV.
During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate.
You couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was.
The world was truly one community.

8786_1	"Absolutely one of the worst movies of the year.
The plot is ridiculous, the characters poorly developed, and the premise irritatingly stupid.
It all begins when Michael Keaton, fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman, loses his beautiful author wife, Anna, to a car accident, possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she's supposed to be rich.
In his grief, Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby: recording nothing and then watching it.
He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his TV.
Pretty soon, he starts to see dead people, thanks to EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders, video cameras, dead cell phones (\Anna cell calling? But she's...DEAD!...Must be ghosts.
Mhmmm.
No other possible explanation.
I'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately.\"") etc.
Why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained.
ANyway, eventually Batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future, and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know.
He gets out of his house just in the nick of time, because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves (\""D*mn it! Can travel between the living and dead using electronics, but I'll be d*mned if we can be on time! Am I right guys? (They nod in bemused agreement).\"").
He tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie (look hard, or you'll miss him!) is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons, who in Raiders of the Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him, looking like the cartoons that they are.
Just then some detectives show up and save the lady.
After Batman's funeral, he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot, evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it.
The little kid just smiles.
Nothing phases that dude, not even when his dad, Batman of course, starts talking to TV's.
The high-point of the movie was when someone's phone rang and some guy yelled out, \""It's Anna!\"""""
7893_4	"At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts.
It all looks very promising from the get go.
With some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute.
The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors.
You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on.
Normally a person in his situation would have several options.
Somehow he does not have those options.
In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault.
Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and God.
And they provide the answer for his problem.
It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is.
Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message.
Since it always is helpful.
But was it really necessary to disguise this message.
This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me.
While the message is good,it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie.
The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved.
In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot.
Don't get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell.
The once brilliant actor is adequate,but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all.

12064_1	"This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time.
All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!.
The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring, and there isn't one character to root for either, plus I hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion.
When John Carradine finally shows up at the end, it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late, and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks, plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee's, as it was rather gory.
I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!.
This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen, as It's absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say avoid it like the plague!, you don't want to go through the torture.
The Direction is absolutely terrible!.
Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! job here, making every thing look cheap, wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace.
The Acting is just as bad.
John Carradine is good in his scene, but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes.
(Carradine Ruled!!).
Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura, as she didn't convince me at all.
Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she did have a creepy smile at the end though.
Rest of the cast, I didn't pay enough attention too, as I had a lot of trouble getting through it, but they were all really bad.
Overall please avoid this,It's not worth the agony!.

4304_1	"This is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for TV.<br /><br />\The Muslims are good; the Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD.\"" <br /><br />That's the message.<br /><br />Using \""entertainment\"" to get across a propaganda message is nothing new.
<br /><br />This movie lays it on thick.<br /><br />And apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up.<br /><br />I know better.
<br /><br />The Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved over 500 shot-down US fliers from the Germans in World War II.
<br /><br />Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British backing behind communist Tito.
Roosevelt followed suit and as a result, after the war ended Yugoslavia was delivered over to communist Tito.<br /><br />And US ally Milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since.<br /><br />This movie is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign engineered by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG) which culminated in the Kosovo \""War,
\"" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of totally false claims by the ICG of \""mass graves\"" in Kosovo filled with \""victims\"" of the nasty Serbs.
The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians (Muslims) had no business being in Serbia's Kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print.<br /><br />I chose this movie to watch because the one-sentence description on the video cover looked interesting.
<br /><br />Imagine my disgust when I discovered I had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia.<br /><br />Instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the Clinton Administration to come clean with the Congress and with the American people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo.

2764_1	"First off, I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen.
Its not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, its just awful.
Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc.
went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment.
All we got was a mindless hour and a half.
The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it.
Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous.
The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail.
Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this.
The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest.
I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.<br /><br />Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting:3/10<br /><br />I don't drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie"

Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script.
Its starts off kinda catching your eye, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and don't get me started about the ending!!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations.

6122_2	"Surely one of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tag-line, “The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time”, isn’t even properly exploited! Although this film was regularly shown on TV in my neck of the woods since my childhood days, its notoriety (for awfulness not erotic content, mind you) kept me away from it until now –
 and I only relented because I have recently enjoyed Bo Derek’s previous film, 10 (1979), and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the Christmas period.
<br /><br />Lead actress/producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl-ish sexual innocent (witness the inept banana scene) and, as was to be expected, she is made to get her clothes off a few times but, as welcome as these scenes were, she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here; Richard Harris, then, chews the scenery incessantly as Jane’s obsessed explorer father, but John Philip Law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in Jane herself;
 newcomer Miles O’Keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie, is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel (which is probably lifted from Johnny Weissmuller anyway!) and, furthermore, is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film’s second half!; for the record, he later starred in two ATOR movies (or would-be CONAN imitators) for Joe D’Amato and the King Arthur-era set, SWORD OF THE VALIANT (1984).
<br /><br />When still an actor, director John Derek (who also serves as his own cinematographer here) had worked with some good film-makers (Cecil B.
De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and a few great ones (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel) but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability: appallingly pretentious at times (witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence) with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions; this was Derek’s seventh film as a director (and his second of four with wife Bo) and, eventually, he would only get to make two more.
<br /><br />The film’s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the Tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF TARZAN, LORD OF THE APES (which, surprisingly enough, I haven’t watched myself yet) – 
a mere three years later!! Nominated for six Razzie Awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O’Keeffe) and winning one for Bo Derek herself, TARZAN, THE APE MAN was co-written by Gary Goddard, the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a (this time animated) heroic figure, MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE (1987) which I will be revisiting presently as well (yay)!
 Despite a charming closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing with around with an orang-utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion, any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting Bo completely white and, fatally, John Derek’s clear disinterest in the character of Tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self-titled movie!!"
10190_1	"After watching this on the MST3K episode, I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from.
It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others.
At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER.
<br /><br />I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot.
like the fact that, even though gas is unavailable, there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country."

the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say.
this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making, just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges.
that can work, if the director actually has any kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential, but here it's just space filler, of no consequence.

 i mean come on!!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without loosing it's original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey!!! kids loves superheroes right??? the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes but this time in superhero form,
 this doesn't sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series, or the new justice league, the result??? bad copies of flash (the road runner) or superman (who else??? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes weren't meant to be dramatic, the were supposed to be funny!!!! as i said before this series sucks, and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world???
 this show tries to be dramatic and action packed, but that's something that few series and anime are able to do, if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show watch Tiny Toons, that's an example that it's possible to bring back to life old characters, but with a good story and respecting the original roots.
too bad that show is already dead, another corporate wise decision i suppose."

I love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that I liked,but this was not one of them.
This movie lacked substance and intensity.OK I get it, the Finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great, but the story is poorly told.
You don't have any real connection with any of the characters and there's no real story line to follow.
You just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed.
If you want a war movie that will keep you riveted, and amazingly enough without battles scenes, then I would suggest \Downfall\"" (WWII German film).
Or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then I would suggest \""Brotherhood of War\"" (Korean war/Korean film).

4283_1	"Sadly, it's true.
\Legiunea sträinä\"" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure.<br /><br />As it was already said, the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form.
Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy, he only gathers a disordered pile of events, unable to follow the least story-line.
The script's level is similar to a \""Cântarea României\"" amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only, turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism, now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology.
The ideas content is zero, and the \""message\"", infantile and didactic, at a kindergarten level.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets.
He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation, to order it in a correct movie scene, to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar.
His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: \""Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere, and all da people is asses!\"" What a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who had created unique works as \""Cursa\"", \""Proba de microfon\"", \""Vânätoarea de vulpi\"" - and even \""Croaziera\"" and \""Glissando\""...

4494_1	"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Continued...<br /><br />From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself.
First we meet a rogue program with the indication we're gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like.
We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage, two 'ghosts' that serve no real purpose and have no character what-so-ever and a bunch of henchmen.
Someone's told me they're vampires (straight out of Blade 2), but they're so undefined I didn't realise.<br /><br />The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle, only for far longer and far far worse.
He has a simple point about cause and effect, makes it, then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid.
His final line before walking off is comparable to Storm's \do you know what happens to a toad...\"" line in X-men in levels of utter bland baddness.
The chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her.<br /><br />And then we get another kung fu fight!!! WHY? Neo is, allegedly, The One.
He can do anything.
He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for.
Kung bloody fu all the time.
And while he can stop 1000 bullets, he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen (vampires?).
I wanted to see mind blowing powers.
I wanted to see him do the wildest, craziest most insane s*** to people because he can do anything.
I got the same as before without the 'wow'.<br /><br />The fabled car chase.
That can't be bad.
Well...
no, it's not.
It's just not what we've been tyold it was going to be.
ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer.
Every one.
So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu fight!!! OK, it's not Neo, but you'd have thought he'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix.
At least taught them something.
It's not hard.<br /><br />\""Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix.
It's not real.
As long as you understand that nothing's real then nothing can really harm you.\""<br /><br />There you go.
Simple.<br /><br />OK, so the chase is not bad.
It's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16 minutes.
It's just so underwhelming.
And still, it gets worse.<br /><br />The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable.
They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews.
They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus's over long, super preachy, monologue.
To make it worse, they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is.
You know basically, but you don't know who's doing what, when, so when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is going to affect what goes on.<br /><br />I'll sum it up though, it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end.
That's the only reason it happens.
Which raises the question, why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself!<br /><br />Neo's journey to the centre of the Matrix (so to speak) is handled equally lazily.
Ooohhh!!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths!!! Woooooo!!! That must've taken a lot of thought.
Only now they're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment.
Man, what a grand finale!!!<br /><br />And then the Architect!!!<br /><br />Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy? Add them together and double it, that's how truly appalling the Architect is.
The only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up the cliffhanging climax.<br /><br />And then he blows it!<br /><br />Let's look at the options he gives Neo.
Choose one door and all humanity dies (except 27!!!).
Choose the other and all humanity dies!!! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it's hero one.
If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there's the potnetial for inner torment and tension.
Also, with Trinity being mid fall, the potential of a real cliffhanger that would've made seeing the third more essential.
But no.
He has save no-one or save the missus.<br /><br />Now, the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end.
The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they didn't notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking.
\""The Oracle told me I'd fall in love with the One, and I love you\""....
Come On!!!! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was?<br /><br />So, what do the Wachowski's do in the sequel? Well, they make the ending of the original look better.
How? Well, by doing almost exactly the same thing again (only swapping characters) only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse.<br /><br />And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger.
It's a reminder.<br /><br />Basically, this film is just bad.
I really didn't want it to be bad, but it is.
Bad in just so many ways.
And to make matters worse, this isn't a film with not enough budget.
It's not a film with too short a schedule.
It's not a film that's been rushed out.
It's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside.
This is exactly the film the Wachowski's set out to make with Warner's fortune fully behind them.
And that's what makes this so awful.
At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it didn't haev enough time or money.<br /><br />Matrix Reloaded.
The worst film ever made? Maybe not quite.
The most disappointing and defalting film ever made.<br /><br />Undeniably.<br /><br />"""

Firstly, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs? Secondly...
what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? And thirdly...
given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released.
You really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this...
and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is.
The movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all.

The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one.
But there was actually no need for a second one.
First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again.
Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap.
I thought it was not very funny.
It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning.
I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too.
However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever).
Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless.
At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true.
She gets baked inside a giant cake.

It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time.
This movie represents the worst of Hollywood.<br /><br />What is this? Is it based on a true story.
Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today.
But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine.
Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie.
The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values.
The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show.
Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A.
transposed in Florida.
Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree.
Is this a romance novel.
The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other.
Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned.
The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water.
Admittedly, the acting is terrible.<br /><br />Let's get to the rest.
The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show.
I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective.
Clearly, the photography budget was excessive.
The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse.
The writing is appalling.
This is one of those movies were the script writes itself.
You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.<br /><br />So I am going to ask, Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours.
But at least a drama series has some kind of focus.
Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together.
Whatever it is, movie or not, it is a piece of crap."
10036_1	"Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie...
I had had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and thought that they wont do it again.
But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack.<br /><br />Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein.....
and what u get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight loss...!!!<br /><br />Music-wise another major disaster...
in the music album, they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts...! that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!!
 :-( If you plan to watch this movie, i would say, watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like ...
'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey...'
<br /><br />Overall very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad English!<br /><br />Go away man, i need to puke!"
3000_3	"The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid.
Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion.
What they didn't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them.
Then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty silly.
The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but that's about it.
The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch.
Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view.
Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity.
There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then there's the couple that has to have sex.
This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them.
It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV! The acting is bearable--not good, but bearable.
Caroline Munro is in this too.
She's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere.
Otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable.
Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves."

It's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending, and it really showed.
Whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this.
I really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort.
When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn.
They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama, so I started watching again.
But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel, same with baltar and six was pretty dumb."

<br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button).
<br /><br />had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes.<br /><br />the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point).

12063_4	"The husband-and-wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films.
As is the case for some other performers of their era (George M.
Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them, in which they're portrayed by other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me', starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker.
<br /><br />In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- Jesse Block and Eve Sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the \second-team\"" Fields and Seeley.
Offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples' living arrangements.
Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room-service rates for every meal they ate, and eventually running out of money.
Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending in comfortable retirement.<br /><br />The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists.
Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930, although I've never heard of them.
Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start performing.
They both have plenty of pep, and she's fairly attractive.<br /><br />I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they're about to break into a dance, but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short.
When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive.<br /><br />I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act.
Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals.
My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully."""

8953_1	"I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one.
I think it was the latter.
First of all, it was inaccurate in many small, yet important details.
One of the first things I noticed was, during Winston's day to day life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc.
he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear.
One of the most important parts of the book, was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT.
This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions.
In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip.
While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.<br /><br />Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it begs the question, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters.
<br /><br /> The large inaccuracies were far more disturbing, however.
First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent, yet crude philosophy.
In the movie, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology.
Which is true, in a sense, when directed with its facism, but if that's all you get out of Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book.
The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy.
When O'Brien is picking at Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love, he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother.
The fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing.
In the end, (careful SPOILER ahead) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this, or the actual power behind the philosophy.
I am in no way saying that the Big Brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing.<br /><br /> Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was awful, no connection whatsoever.
<br /><br /> And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he made contact with him.
In the movie, they just jump the gun.<br /><br /> But that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption: because its impossible NOT to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours.
How could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours? At the very least, the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections.
Anything less is just pointless.<br /><br />If you loved the book, and I mean TRULY adored it, you will not approve of this movie, and chances are, you already knew you wouldn't.
Because the book is unfilmable, and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.<br /><br />Two stars out of ten"

The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it).
This film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally had no effect on me.
I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film.
It is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards.

I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous.
As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment.
I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines.
These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction.

<br /><br />From then onwards the film descended into outright silliness, and at times became almost embarrassing to watch.

Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent \""plot\"" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance.

3245_4	"David Mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-man's movie, a movie that makes you question everybody and everything.
I saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.<br /><br />The movie is about a female psychologist named Margaret who is also a best-selling author.
Margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone.
She tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this film).
She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her.
Intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book).
She then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.<br /><br />I don't feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by Mike and his cronies to swindle Margaret out of $80,000.
<br /><br />First of all, the big twist towards the end was VERY predictable.
Any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads.
Not only that, but the audience (and the main character) knows that they're dealing with con men, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has herself been conned? Besides, Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people, yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind, she knows full well that Mike is a con artist.
<br /><br />Secondly, we are led to believe that Margaret was conned from the very beginning, yet in order for the con to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do.
First, she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt, allowing her to meet the con men in the first place.
If she hadn't done this, the entire con would have failed.
I just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt.
Not only that, but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? Did they simply show up at that bar every night, hoping she would come and see them? Another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade.
What are the odds of this happening? And yet the whole con is based on this premise.<br /><br />Another problem I had is with the ending.
Margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on Mike.
At first, Mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con, but that falls through, so the ultimate ending is her gunning Mike down in an airport baggage area.
Somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade.
Not only that, but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her.<br /><br />Ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled.
And if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying."
7553_2	"A phenomenal achievement in awfulness.
It's actually hilariously awful.<br /><br />First off...Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the Over-Emoting Category in his acting class.
Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a \hero\"" character that you have no vested interest in.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters.
He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all \""b****es\"" a few times too.
I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.<br /><br />I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance.
By the time she finally makes her appearance (bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead) it seems like all hope may be lost.
She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue, white, and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.
<br /><br />This movie is so wrong-headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.
<br /><br />Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms.
Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.<br /><br />Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promising acting career in a \""brawl\"" with Cage.
<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage screaming \""Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?\"" for no reason.
<br /><br />Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear feet on) and then doing some karate moves to some villains.
<br /><br />And you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement.
<br /><br />Needless to say, if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal.
There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send-up of \""hysteria\"" films...only to be reminded when Cage would scream/shout/whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously.

It's as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White, except nowhere near as well made or interesting.

Holy Mother Mary of God was this bad.
I mean, I gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film, but it let me down at every turn.
Like so many other B movies, the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous.
It's a shame they attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco.<br /><br />The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual Halloween haunted house fund raiser, when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell.
Well that's the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy's relationship escapades, abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot.
Very little of the actual story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book.
It actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble.
<br /><br />The film is essentially about frat boy relationships.
This IS NOT what the movie is billed as.
I'm tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm.
The acting is about as bad as it gets, it's atrocious! The script is unintentionally funny.
The cinematography is just plain lazy.
The whole film is amateur night.
This movie actually makes the SyFy channel movie productions look like masterpieces.<br /><br />The last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they weren't producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences.

They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers.
The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen.
The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this.
He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians.
Like every film that defends the war (e.g.
\""We Were Soldiers\"") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia.
And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there.
Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation.
It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them.
\""Do we get to win this time?\"" Yes, you do."""
10770_1	"Might contain possible spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off.
House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all.
Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films.
Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stunk.
I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young.
All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality."
4782_4	"1st watched 12/24/2009  4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that doesn't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual-based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen for them.
The three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to Washington D.C.
to enlist the then President of the United States, Herbert Hoover.
This trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, which makes the story kind of like a Disney \animals on the run\"" movie and doesn't quite fit here.
At the ending, there isn't any details given as to how the President helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie, in my opinion.
The movie does eventually bring tears, but it takes too long to get to this.
The movie isn't supposed to have been an original TV movie(according to IMDb) but it has the obvious fade-outs that make it look this way  so I'm not sure their information is accurate.
All in all, this is a simple movie(that could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas-like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance."""
9_1	"This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen.
It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess.
If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing.
I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day.
Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful."
8772_1	"There's nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill.
The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer/director/editor/God goofed.
He should have eaten humble pie (if not for his own sake then for the men who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician that wasn't related to him in some way (and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of \Apocalypse Now\"" on some cheap Indian drug), hired a real professional crew, thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story.
Unfortunately he, like the bigwigs of the Indian Army, made decisions that were terrible for his actors, and terrible for his audience.
We all died over and over.
<br /><br />Please don't do that again, Sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal<br /><br />ps: Next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest he hire more than one Nepali to represent the team.
Surely there are plenty of Nepali men working in Bombay--last count was 40,000 to half a million."""
11544_3	"I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress.

It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped.
They then decide to go for some revenge.
Sounds good, right? Well, it's not.
The story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird.
I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see.

It just didn't work out.

7662_3	"This should be my kind of movie.
Even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, I like \Congo,\"" and \""Allan Quatermaine\"" movies.
I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies.
Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.<br /><br />1.
Horror/Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2.
I'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure.
3.
Super-natural enemies with quality FX.
4.
Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy.
5.
Tara Reid is hot.<br /><br />So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass.
The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic.
But now on to some of the many faults.<br /><br />Tara Reid.
Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is truly awful.
We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year.
I don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely.
Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn.
I mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad.
Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.<br /><br />Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old.
I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time.
<br /><br />The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course.
In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something.
Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during.
The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a \""Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities.\"" I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.
<br /><br />There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, \""photonic\"" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.
<br /><br />Jesus, I can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements.
The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth.
I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race.
I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself.
How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which \""fuse\"" with the spine of their host)Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug \""didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,\"" thank god.
Oh, and the people with these \""fused\"" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies.
Yeah we get zombies.<br /><br />So lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.<br /><br />Also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.
<br /><br />Not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie."""
5659_4	"A disappointing end to a season that started so well ...<br /><br />Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on TV in any series, where as this was rather bad.
<br /><br />Well I am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment, but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series.
<br /><br />Its almost as if the corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up.
They failed and rather spoilt everything.<br /><br />Lets hope this is not a trend for the future.<br /><br />Still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done."
10175_3	"Couldn't go to sleep the other night.
So I got up, flipped on the tube & this movie was on.<br /><br />Film makers bit off more than they could chew.
Just as ambitious in scope as \Forrest Gump\"" was.
But Gump read like an fairy-tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era.
TGMB just relies on tired clichés to tell the story.
Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to ham it up.
Every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's archetype.<br /><br />Take how we're introduced to Finnegan: Hugging his black maid & receiving a framed picture of MLK.
Criminey, talk about heavy-handed.
Why not just give him a t-shirt saying \""I Heart Black People\""?<br /><br />Sunshine: \""Isn't free love groovay, man? Oh no, I didn't have my period.\"" <br /><br />Mary Beth: \""I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA.\"" Uh, excuse me? There was nothing square about LA in the 60s.
Rather than take the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat whine about not going there.<br /><br />Can't even remember the black kid's name.
He was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are.<br /><br />Thing is, period pieces don't have to be this cheesy.
Take \""Dazed & Confused.\"" Look how we're introduced to the football hero, Randall Floyd.
We don't first see him on the football field.
In fact, we never see him play football.
We're introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.<br /><br />In \""Dazed\"" feminism isn't a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up.
It's much more organic, more serious than that.
It's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about Gilligan's Island.
Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings.
But real life is like that.<br /><br />Some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant.
I agree! Which is why I feel so disappointed by this piece of Baby-Boomer pornostalgia."""

He even had the red jacket.
It was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him.
The car/guy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street.
And then proceeded to drive off.
That is all I remember.

I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won.

But this show just made me SICK! I'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show.
I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love.
But Adrianne, you had been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS.
It didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed.
And I don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready.
If it's meant to be, then why not just ENJOY each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring.
And Chris, shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway! You've been through two failed marriages, how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons.
Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage."
6818_3	"in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball.
joe pesci...<br /><br />and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.<br /><br />pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad.
the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn't even well-played.
instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs.
then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable.

This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years.
not only was the acting incredibly bad, the storyline (if you can call it that) was just as bad.
Offcourse everyone knows what's going to happen within the first 5 minutes.
Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment.
That however, is not the case.
There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the 2 leading actors.
It was unfortunately a waste of my time, and certainly a waste of my money.
<br /><br />and the 2 of merely for trying"
5544_3	"While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film, it's surprisingly watchable on several levels.
First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick).
While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film.
This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor.
Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s.
<br /><br />A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all.
The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad.
For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water, it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them.
Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry!!! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film--so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film--since both of them starred in many grade-z horror films.
In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over-generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans."
4264_1	"this movie let me down decidedly hard.
it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script.
The story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best.
There were so many elements to this story that were not explained, or were forced into place with out any real thought.
elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more, and the cannons need to be written in better.
the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around.
everyone likes a good \little guy overcomes\"" story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be.
While it did have some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence it was lackluster due to a lack of choreography.
this made for a maddeningly boring watch<br /><br />it could have been so good :("""
5958_4	"In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr.
Anthony Blake (David Gale, the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it's definitely Dr.
Blake not Dr.
Blakely) is the director and founder of the famed 'Psychological Research Institute' and also host's a local T.V.
programme called 'Independent Thinkers'.
He uses this T.V.
show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence.
Dr.
Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it's spinal cord as a tail thingy.
Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger.
Meanwhile at the local high-school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski (Tom Bresnahan) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets.
Jim is sent to Dr.
Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems.
While there Dr.
Blake hooks Jim up to, well something I'm not actually sure what.
This whatever it is, is attached to the brain.
At first Jim is able to resist the brain's mind control.
The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it's plans.
Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car.
Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet (Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston) but is handed back to Dr.
Blake's assistant Verna (George Buza) soon after by Officer Marks (Harry Booker).
The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it's mind control techniques, and with 'Independent Thinkers' going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it's evil plan for world domination! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world!<br /><br />Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either.
The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V.
storyline.
It moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring.
No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it's just there and that's it we have to accept it.
The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there's the T.V.
mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr.
Blake that isn't explained at all.
Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap.
The acting isn't great but I've seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this? In fact this role is similar to Gale's role in Re-Animator (1985) even down to his character's deaths in both films.
The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big.
Each stage is just made of rubber.
It doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy, just cheap.
There's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it decapitation.
The nudity is provided by Dr.
Blake's assistant Vivian (Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack) before she gets eaten.
The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it.
Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T.V.
for free."

But, our long haired heroine, oblivious to all the signs, shacks up with her family the Nortons, which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter.
Even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving, and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths.
But enough of that..
domestic animals are being sacrificed, old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene, even the quiet ones.
Oh, and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.<br /><br />In fact, it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather, smelt what they'd signed up for and gone AWOL.
Yes, I know it's hard to get into movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not one on your CV you'd want.
If would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting.
Featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill Laurel Barnett, and another almost equally as bad by the charisma-free child actress Rosalie Cole (The next Dakota Fanning she ain't) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.
<br /><br />This involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed, while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood, a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on.
But back up a minute..
earlier on they were in the car, and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it.
So do they stay where they are safe? No of course not, they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown.
<br /><br />Finally, the film closes.
It doesn't end, it just goes to a grinding halt.
The main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood, as if nothing horrible had happened.
But, my dear viewer, something horrible has happened.
You have just sat through one of the most lamebrained, boring horror films you're ever likely to see, and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back.
Just think..

I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film.<br /><br />Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers.
Jacqueline Susann ripped into him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so.
Which is why this work smelt.
Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences.
Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire.
The supporting cast was not a help either.<br /><br />Oooooh...
this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse.
I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done.

If you are thinking about watching it, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene).
The rest of the movie is horrible.
I think high school plays probably have better acting.
The plot makes no sense at all.
The set was pretty lame, and it wasn't even good to make fun of.
It was just dull and very very bad! I watched this on Starz so I thought it had to be at least decent.
The mini description sounded like it'd be alright.
The girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch some horrible music video.
The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them.
Just cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness.
Kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot sucks.

8309_3	"Apparently none of the previous reviewers,most of whom praise the film for its accuracy, have actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur.
The most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between Pasteur and Napoleon III.
Back in the 1930's the latter was invariably shown in a bad light.
While far from an admirable character-he was an inept politician and a self-appointed \military genius\"" who allowed France to be dragged into a disastrous war,he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here.
He had an intelligent interest in science,and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring.
Far from exiling Pasteur, he was his PATRON,building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research.
While the lab was under construction, Pasteur became gravely ill.A bureaucrat, deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead, ordered work halted on his own authority.When the emperor heard about this, his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck-passing, and work promptly resumed.
The Emperor personally visited Pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab.The emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteur's projects,and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the emperor's favorites.
Pasteur's main worry concerning the Emperor was that Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything, and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience.Pasteur, a very modest man, was always protesting this, but Napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him,and Pasteur despite his misgivings, always came through.
They always had a close and friendly relationship,and after the Emperor was overthrown, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him,grateful to the end of his life.<br /><br />The part about his daughter having the baby, and Pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor, never happened.
The part about the anthrax and rabies, for which he was famous, is generally correct, but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false.He was famous and respected at the time this happened.This movie is OK from a dramatic standpoint,but very distorted as biography."""

Therefore, we get a \film\"" that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts (often in slow-motion), and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage.

5803_1	"POSSIBLY VERY MINOR SPOILERS<br /><br />This movie is billed as the first Russian horror movie.
Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, \The Witch\"" (its Russian title) will take a place of dishonor in the gallery of horrible Russian movies.
It is based on Nikolai Gogol's story \""Viy\"" which is a classic in Russia.
\""Based\"" is the key word here since no familiarity with the story is required.
Instead, the less you know about Gogol, the better.
<br /><br />It is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture.
The spate of American remakes of foreign films is a prime example, but then again, Sturgess turned Kurosawa's Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven with splendid results, and Kurosawa transferred Shakespeare's Macbeth into Japan to make an incredibly powerful Throne in Blood, while King Lear became a riveting Ran.
However, with \""The Witch,\"" we have Russians transplanting a Russian classical tale onto the American soil.
The movie was shot in Estonia in English with the aim of dubbing it into English using American actors and have reasonably synchronous lip movements.
<br /><br />As a natural consequence, lost is the colorful Ukrainian background for the story, in comes a drab American small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book manual.
Gone is the boozy seminarian Khoma Brutus, instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win Pullitzer prize, and who at the same time writes about X-Files-like events and frequents Miss Boobs contests.
(I never thought Pullitzer prize was given for that kind of writing, now I humbly stand corrected.) In a strange nod to Russianness, the journalist is named Ivan Berkhoff.
They should've named him John Smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, clichéd and generic than this movie.
<br /><br />Berkhoff goes to a town named Castleville, gets stranded on a dirt road, staggers on until he finds a dilapidated house and is rather un-welcomed by an old crone.
All that to the accompaniment of a radio announcement about the forces of evil being at their most powerful, and people better staying indoors and avoiding water.
Need I mention that it's raining really hard? After a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing, the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest, he's mistaken for a priest, and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights.
At this point, the action supposedly starts.
Those who have time to kill are welcome to it.
<br /><br />What is wrong with this film? Everything, starting with the dialog and down to the prop department.
The dialog which I heard in Russian was clearly originally written in English, and it was compiled exclusively from clichés and platitudes picked from American films.
The actors just as clearly struggled with English because the timing of their speech was labored and unnatural, and the Russian dubbing followed suit.
The acting is mostly atrocious, and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they don't have anything approaching a range of facial expressions.
For the most part, they're just blank or you wish they were.
The only exceptions being the sheriff played by Lembit Ulfsak, a fine Estonian actor, and Arnis Lizitis who plays a wheelchair bound resident of Castleville.
Oh, and a rooster of course who's absolutely natural on camera! I know actors complain of being upstaged by dogs and cats but when Nikolaev is upstaged by a rooster it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film.<br /><br />There wasn't a single scary moment in the entire film, and there wasn't a single original moment in the film either.
Mind you, this comment's coming from somebody who's rather inexperienced with horror.
The film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the genre's inception.
At a critical moment, the camera lingers lovingly on a kerosene lamp.
The lamp promptly goes out.
It must have seen a few horror movies, too.
An example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment, a character jumps out of a bathtub and runs at the camera.
He's wearing something the looks like loincloth! It doesn't get any more idiotic than this!<br /><br />Those in Russia who liked it claim it should've been advertised as a mystical thriller.
I wasn't thrilled either.
It was run-of-the-mill from start to finish.
I particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town behaved as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie, except they weren't quite sure whether it had zombies or not.
Therefore, some of them acted zombie-like just in case.
<br /><br />The makers of the film say it's about finding faith.
Such a fine collections of idiotic actions, stupidly contrived moments, and, yes, clichés, doesn't deserve to be about finding faith.
The movie is so thoroughly and utterly fake it deserves only to be an exhibit in a wax figure museum."""
2364_4	"\Freddy's Dead\"" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film.

And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater.
It has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter.

6248_2	"Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming: science goes out the window and \belief\"" and \""consensus\"" becomes the topic of discussion.<br /><br />It's because of that fact that I give a failing mark to Al Gore's documentary.
<br /><br />Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of \""belief\"" and \""consensus\"".
<br /><br />Of course, when you're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to \""stop Global Warming\"" you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans.
Maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has over-ceded the next Ice Age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet.<br /><br />But the fact remains that we don't know.<br /><br />so we're asked to \""believe\"" in the \""consensus\"".
Never mind that any scientist that strays from the \""consensus\"" is ostracized.
Never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus.
Einstein didn't \""believe\"" in the consensus, neither did Copernicus or Galileo.<br /><br />So why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions? If Global Warming is so incontrovertible, surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening.

5292_4	"I can't recommend this film as a date movie.
Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent, Beckettian account of one of Dante's circles of hell, frankly.
At the centre of it is Ray Winstone, who has done this sort of character before but never as well.
The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie.
It's an acting masterclass.<br /><br />Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour.
Charlie Creed-Miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for.
Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors, maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor.

205_4	"I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it.
But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else.
The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment.
Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on.
What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head.
The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).

Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay.
That's devastating but not apocalyptic.
Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave.
Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didn't seem so awful in this movie.
Actually I didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been cast by the wave.
Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it.
It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife.

This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the low.
With obviously low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so-called 'special effects', shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces.
The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some very nice tits.

The main object is to survive.
But he's not in an arena.
He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters.

I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not.
First, Hitler wasn't angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child.
Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is highly probable that Hitler, in reality, was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret.
Third, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming.
How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming.
That's a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him (of course, not Jews).<br /><br />This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong.

Then it got boring.<br /><br />The acting is the scariest part of the movie.
While great acting is not to be expected, this was laughably bad and, honestly, provided all of the entertainment that was to be had.
This is the plus side to the movie.
Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing, lighting, and the editing.<br /><br />This movie provides way too many \What the %$@# is going on?\"" moments.
There are many moments, such as the mother having strange fits at dinner, and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie.
Along the lines of dinner, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served.
During the meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside.
Then cuts back in.
And speaking of darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate, where apparently it isn't nighttime unless it's raining.
And speaking of darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit you can't see what's going on half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything.
In one of the climactic scenes, you can't even tell what you're supposed to be seeing that's so shocking.<br /><br />And when it comes to climactic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst.

Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film, (SPOILER), he tells his star player \downtown\"" to hit a home run, clearly \""downtown\"" viewed this as a good move.
He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie.
Now if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat, the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game."""
8642_1	"I have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary.
As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking to myself, does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn't a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting.
SO, either way, it is pretty bad.
I actually didn't make it to the end.
I had to shut it off.
I am a NYC Police Officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers.
So, I took it a little personal.
Maybe I was blinded by that, and it isn't as bad as I personally think it is.
Everyone has their own opinion."
1010_4	"I rented this movie last week.
I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising.
And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene.
He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again.
I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen.
He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever.
Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment.
His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en.
It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good.
It's about one of the very few good things about this movie.
He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special.
He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good.
I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened."

A former policeman, a former sky champion, and, now, a TERRIBLE actor.
\Alex L'Ariete\"" was planned to be a TV \""mini serial\"", but the Italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels.
Now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie.
The script it's simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 years old kid work.
But what really blows you away it's the amateurish acting: Alberto Tomba, who actually was not believable as a policeman himself, plays terribly a totally silly character: a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open! (\""ariete\"" is \""ram\"").
This super-guy will try to save a young nice girl life (an actual italian \""little\"" TV showgirl, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): nice but absolutely inept in the acting.

8710_1	"I haven't seen the first two - only this one which is called Primal Species in England.
I don't think I'll be bothering to look them out though.<br /><br />This is an awful film.
Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters.
Everything about it is so nasty.
The most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredible jerk.
No-one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army.
He lasted for ages but I was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off - I was having nightmares he was going to survive.
The Colonel was rubbish too - all moody pouts and clueless shouting.
And the specky Doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno.
I was waiting for her to take her glasses off, shake her hair and turn into a vamp, but she didn't.
Pity that, as it would've livened the film up no end.<br /><br />Didn't Roger Corman used to make half decent films once?"

If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it.
If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead.
DO NOT try to make both at the same time, it doesn't work.
For example, having a goofy \comic relief\"" character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head just makes you look like you had NO IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make.
This one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture.
A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble.
There is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence.

10420_2	"OK, I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a \classic\"" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, I must admit: I really hated it.
<br /><br />We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered at the very words \""Watership Down\""- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it.
To be honest, I wish I hadn't bothered.
I gave it the benefit of the doubt; generally I don't like to stop watching a film half way through.
This was an exception.
It was really, really, excruciatingly, sickeningly dull.
This film was possibly the slowest thing I've ever watched (imagine a doped-up snail in space), and really didn't \""do it\"" for me.
The art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.
<br /><br />I'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area.
Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across.
For me, I kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because I'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude (oh I'm so terribly English).
I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.
<br /><br />If I were to praise it in any way, I'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning.
Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature.
The musical score was not bad, too.<br /><br />So, to conclude, this film is pretty poor.
I couldn't watch it the whole way through, or I'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom.
Granted, it isn't \""Torque\"" bad, but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes, so I've given it a 2/10.
<br /><br />Hope this helps."""
1730_1	Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it.
I find it the most annoying program on TV.
There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable.
The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience.
That way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is.
However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast.
It sickens me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was.
The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters.
Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me.
That is all.
8329_4	"I question its importance to Queer Cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence.<br /><br />Three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner.
I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes, that alone didn't sit well with me.
Weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times.<br /><br />There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film.
More like a 45 minute Boy's Brief short rather than a fleshed out full-length film.
It had a certain erotic flair, male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts.<br /><br />The 1st part: Boxer/Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin.
Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? I felt as though their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion.
We needed more information about them and less Parking Lot/Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying \What do you want?\"" <br /><br />The 2nd part: Danny wants his buddy, Tony, to beat him up while he jacks-off.
Tony doesn't seem to mind, but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby -- not even after they do it in the nude.
This tale lacks the all-important transition from \""I'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun\"" to \""I think I might be gay and hitting him because I'd like to spread his ass and do him S/M style.\"" A very important thing to leave out.
<br /><br />Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time.
The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought.
Furthermore, it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film.
Yes, the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy.
The make-up (bruises and cuts) however was on par with a grammar school talent show.<br /><br />There wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic.
The film made no statement, squandered time, and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment.
Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach, that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously."""
6211_2	"I'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie, but few minutes after it started, I wanted to leave the theater.
For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me, but then realized it's a waste of time, there was just nothing there.
I stayed only because I had another show after it.<br /><br />Design: some designs where quite beautiful, mostly of the environment, but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design.
They look great while still - on posters and screenshots, but not when they have to come to life! They just didn't work, mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make: technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D, that would make you feel that the character is alive.
You need a lot of effort and knowledge (hence money) to create something that really feels like hair, skin, fabric, etc.
Those characters in the movie were made out of \cloth\"", and that just didn't work! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality, where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic.
It just didn't have the feel of a material, that dolls are made of (that's what those characters meant to be).
I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters.
It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game.
I don't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen, don't know about you...<br /><br />Animation was also a disgrace.
I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in \""9\"".
It was stiff, boring, almost lacked any imagination or mood.
It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw, and that doesn't add to it any good...<br /><br />And all that - the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story, right?! That was not the case here.
Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie.
It was below any level.
It starts straight forward, it goes straight forward and it ends the same.
There is no twist, no surprise, no good dialogs, even no development.
We've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and \""9\"" is just one of them, and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie.
The characters don't even have time to get into the story - they are just there, showing themselves almost immediately, and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what's going on.
It just didn't work.
There are also many repetitive action sequences, that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story...
<br /><br />Acting, sound and script - oh my gosh, what can I tell, it was pathetic.
Bad story has a bad script, and except dialogs like \""No, don't do it!\"" \""I will do it!\"" \""But...
you cannot do it alone!\"" \""We can do it together!\"" \""But there are rules!\"" \""But we have to save him!\"" etc etc and so on, and repeating itself all the time, so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs, there were those non stop \""Ahh\"" and \""Ohhh\"" and\""Ehh\"", and \""Oooh\"", and \""Whatchout\"", and \""Run!\"" and \""OhOhh!\"" that were following almost every jump, run, or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed.
<br /><br />Conclusion: bad acting, bad animation, bad sound, bad story, bad script, bad characters, everything expected, no surprises, no twist, nothing.
Only some good designs are not worth the time.
BIG NO!"""
1347_1	"Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon.
I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's Christmas special \Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas\"".
Some Gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but they need to compare it to DiC's 2002 release of \""Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge\"" for then, they will find the second season to be absolute gold.<br /><br />Being a Gadget fan, I couldn't resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that wasn't Gadget Boy-related.
I purchased the film, and I swore to myself that I'd be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series.
I was not even prepared for what I was about to watch.<br /><br />There was barely a shred of the original show still intact.
<br /><br />Here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie: *The humor is non-existent from the original series.<br /><br />*Penny and Brain (originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget) are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals.
<br /><br />*The original music by Saban & Levy is not there, and the score that exists is sub-par.
(Understood that Saban has his own production company now, but at least \""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas\"" had good music, even without Saban.) *Don't expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets which made the show so endearing, such as gadget-copter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet,gadget-coat (which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing), as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets.
In this movie, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs.
That kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show, and simply aren't necessary to change.
<br /><br />*The gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast-talking, supposedly \""hip\"" convertible.
All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa.
<br /><br />*Chief Quimby is now very short-tempered and even mean to Gadget.
He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a bit much.
<br /><br />*Penny no longer has a computer book.
<br /><br />Are there any positives to this movie? OK, here goes...<br /><br />*Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget.<br /><br />*In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series: the Great Wambini (classic \""Gadget\"" villain from the second season, voiced by Louis Nye).
<br /><br />Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you're out of luck.
Life is about making choices and living by those choices.
Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson.
The lesson learned here: keep to the original formula! \""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"" True Gadget fans should steer clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed.<br /><br />Hopefully, DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of \""Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1,\"" containing the first 22 episodes of the series.
As a true Gadget fan, lover of 80's animation and many of DiC's programs, I urge you the viewer to purchase \""Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1\"" and \""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas\"" DVD's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories."""

\Life's dramas\"", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even the writing has any bite or wit).
The cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another, and the music and photography are lugubrious (a couple of the visual effects are laughable, indie-cliché touches that reek of a puny budget).
Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure but I think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men, estranged brothers growing closer, never quite gels, never feels natural or seems lived in.
It's an attempt to get inside a male relationship, but the careful, sterile presentation is a cheat.

6870_4	"A well-intentioned movie about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of devout Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald).
who is deeply unhappy.
Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she's already an expertjewelry.
He also starts an affair with her, and then when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he dumps her and betrays her to the family, which shuts her out.
There's a subplot in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her, and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but why is not clear.
Much is not clear, unfortunately, including what is going on with Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe there's a fire inside her and maybe it's not from god, and what this means, and what the magical beggar woman tells her means.
To an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra-orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly liberated.
Nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well-thought-out.
The title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good womanand yet it's the bastard Sender who quotes it to Sonja.
Zellweger struggles with the part; she's supposed to be a Jew from the mid-west and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times it's taken on the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn.
She's at her best when she's being tough and taking charge, but ultimately the movie's a mess."

Good production values for a Thai horror flick.
But the bland script never generates suspense, the director approaches the material entirely conventionally, and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds.
At one point, a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead, and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun.
Bad writing  you're soaking in it! <br /><br />Some icky gore effects, including a really tasteless late-term-fetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach.

1232_1	"It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this \movie.\"" No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing.
She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career.
This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.<br /><br />The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.<br /><br />**After she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her.
Tell me, what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? I don't mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back.
But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level.
No woman would do that unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them.
None of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged.
And by the way, when the security guard approached, as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream?? <br /><br />**When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes.
She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood.
I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should've ran.<br /><br />(I didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because I loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it).
<br /><br />**Why would she carry a loud, Red Toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? When she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox.
First she resists, then eventually opens it.
And takes out a wrench.
This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie.
When asked to open the box, she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch/push/open/manipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical/shoot him in the face/render him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all along.
It feels like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs.
<br /><br />**Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.
<br /><br />**When she was running away, how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude.
She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.
<br /><br />**Finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her.
How ridiculous.
As one of the thugs even said, they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate.
Even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?"""
5337_1	"There's so many negative reviews about \Stay away, Joe\"" in here I just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen.
Here's a side you haven't heard yet.<br /><br />Elvis Presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because I don't have to think when I watch them.
That means I don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with.
I can just kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy-going rock n' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all.
<br /><br />In my books \""Stay away, Joe\"" definitely falls into the \""so bad it's good\""-category.
Now if you're like me and appreciate \""the trash value\"", this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience.
It's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways.
In the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry.
In a nutshell: I love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this.
I still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic."""
6340_1	"This is the kind of movie i fear the most.
Arrogant and Irresponsible, it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all Colombian people.
The performances are godawul, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who looks right out of a Tim Burton nightmare), to Díaz, who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one-dimensional, so cliched and so badly written all he´s left to work with is a mustache.
Not to mention the gratuitous ending, a gore fest so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood cringe.
It fails in all ways, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing, and most of all directing, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity.
I can't say anything good about this waste of money, except that i hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsability from this mean-intended fiasco."

<br /><br />well, this whole film is something of a spoiler...
a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against, a tale of lost youth that doesn't know where it itself is going.
<br /><br />i just saw this at the tribeca film festival.
this film wasn't just bad, it was really bad.<br /><br />the acting is inconsistent, the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth, and farnsworth's acting was very bad in particular.<br /><br />from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place 'graphic' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios...
it sucked the big one.
<br /><br />i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy, updated 'drugstore cowboy' with a touch of 'natural born killers' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking (outside of some frat-level gore) as the ladder.
<br /><br />more than anything, someone needed to really A) edit the screenplay <br /><br />(there are some things in there to build on and clearly <br /><br />deals with a worthy subject...

I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines.

\"" Leonor Watling is also quite good.

The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes.
The characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that I found myself asking the question \How did we get here?\"" at least a half dozen times during the movie.

There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town...
you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie.
Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule.
There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments.
My final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film."

So I thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels, I was wrong.
This movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one, it had the plot continue and thats it.
It was like bad outtakes from part one or something.<br /><br />I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here.
I was so happy about Glenn Danzig being in this film, but don't blink you'll miss him.
There was a full cast full of crappy actors and people I don't like such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals.
However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he's one of the funniest people on earth.<br /><br />This movie will make you like the first one a little less, so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1.
I am gonna wait a few days before I watch part 3 and I pray it is better than this crap.<br /><br />The last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film.

He's an ugly, slimy, rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas.
His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie.
Very bad editing.
Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast.
Plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west.
I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century.
A woman cop is assigned to show him around Malta (who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck.
She must be insane!<br /><br />The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie.
Their dancing is shown throughout the film and I began to bond with the sleazy women.
Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to dumb his way out of something.
The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was happy it was finally over.
You'll never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie.<br /><br />It's so hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond movies...very weird! Anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on MST3K sometime.

Like I said, I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, I struggled to stay awake.

The story and characters COULD be very good, if say the directing, the actors and other little nibby things were made better.
But the film is just bad, the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it.

7702_1	"I'm a Black man living in a predominantly Black city.
That being said, I have some major misgivings about Tyler Perry's work.
I realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him, because he's Black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture.
But, I honestly do believe that, were Perry White, this film would have had the NAACP, Al Sharpton, and Jessie Jackson all over his ass.<br /><br />I have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil.
The characters are poorly written and acted.
The jokes are so bad, I have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny.
I'm just going to break this big pile of sh-t down.<br /><br />Madea=suck.
The character may have had some appeal, but it doesn't anymore.
When the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless.
She is unnecessary.<br /><br />The situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesh-t.
If a woman was so scared to death of her husband, why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed.
Wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work.
At any rate, the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that I hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't.<br /><br />Then there are the two lovebirds.
A bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he's making his rounds.
I couldn't believe it.
I really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more.
But, what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch.
I don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes.
Morose victim and psycho momma.
No matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was one constant.
The bus driver wasn't going to get any.
He even married her without sampling the goods--WTF! <br /><br />Then there's the family reunion scene.
Here we've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos, grinding for the sake of grinding, shirtless, overly musclebound, b-ball, plus the great taste of Maya Angelou.
When those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, was I wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack.
All this crap is going on at the reunion, in laughably easy to separate groups, and then they ring a bell.
When they do, everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too, just like a pack of Pavlov's doggies--WTF!! <br /><br />Then you have the final five minutes of the film.
In it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress.
There is an impromptu wedding where Black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling--WTF!!! The only reason to watch it this far, besides testing your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well.
Guess what, it doesn't happen.
Instead, Perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe, ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness--WTF!! <br /><br />I'm pretty sure that, if given a day , I could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks.
Don't even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perry's films.
I'm just going to say this.
In my opinion, as a Black guy, D.W.
Griffith's legacy lives on.
The irony is that it is doing so through a Black man who will be praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did, selling us down the river.
I only wish Perry's films were dudes so I could kick them in the nuts.
Thanks a lot, dude!! What are you going to follow this up with in 2009, a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in Colonial America?"

Lommel claims to have written this, if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages.

1399_3	"Ouch, what a painfully BORING Sci-Fi movie! And that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! During the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files.
As he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed.
Figures From then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing.
More like dull, pointless and vague.
Scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway.
They all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed; yet I fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device.
Perhaps I missed something, but I doubt it.
The interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities.
So basically, \The Brain Machine\"" just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room.
The film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a THOUSAND stagnant shots of buildings! The relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated EVERY SINGLE TIME by a five-second shot of the places.
Either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all Sci-Fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves.
Staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying, I assure you.
James Best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent, but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time.

After all I've had heard about this film, I was almost scared to watch it.
The murders are boring.

 <br /><br />So 3 out of 10! <br /><br />Sometimes the music is speeded up! Especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in! <br /><br />Sometimes it is slowed! As if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy! 
 <br /><br />As another one bites the dust! As if in a \spagetti Western\"" this has much similarity to! <br /><br />It's not that the Italians can't produce quality productions! There was a series of TV movies with a heading like \""Octopus\"" numbered about 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts! And they were excellent! But alas, you won't find it here!!!
 <br /><br />I assumed it was made about 1960s! Sadly it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /><br />Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters! 
 <br /><br />Amidst it all, either in bar-room brawl or in observing the latest sea-side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark, the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern, as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development! 
 <br /><br />At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly, for his ex-wife! <br /><br />But of course, even if the music fails to awaken our realisation, we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices, as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge! 
 <br /><br />And near the end, someone thought of a twist! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable! But stay tuned, folks, for you may find another twist! If you are watching closely! To, more or less, warm your heart!
 <br /><br />Follow the advice of the hero, and have a few beers along the way! It'll make your viewing of \""Night of the Sharks\"" more enjoyable! <br /><br />Then you'll be ready for something like a \""007\"" movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over!!!"""
5503_1	"I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing that I can tell you right away, there is NO comparison.
This film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive.
A martian that took different shapes.
Special effects that looked like something that a little child would create.
In contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin.
The only highlight in this film, yes, actually there was one, occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end.
He wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the TV series.
But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey."
2715_3	"The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people.
Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views.
Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news.
This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black.
During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles.
Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family.
Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie.
The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided."
696_4	"Eh, not a particular good slasher flick.
So-so acting, effects, decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack.<br /><br />There are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes.
Apart from that, there's a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or chasing after red herrings; more killing of time, than of people.
There are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer, not partial to any one implement.
The killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well.
The identity isn't revealed towards the end, and motive is pretty thin, and we really don't care.<br /><br />Supposedly the movie takes place around Christmas, but this isn't a major factor.
One scene gets lit by Christmas lights, that's about it.<br /><br />The movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the videotape I watched.
Some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes.
The ending should have been stronger than it was.

Comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him.

11674_2	"I am a Motion Picture Production major at Wright State University in Ohio, and yesterday I was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god-awful film in class.
We were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us, but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films - a complete disaster.<br /><br />The problem with early sound films was that Hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they weren't good at memorizing lines.
So producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors.
Sounds like a great idea, right? Well, the kind of acting one does on stage doesn't show up too well on film.
Most of the actors in \Atlantic\"" look and sound like they're acting in a play, which results in lots of hearty laughs at the over-acting.
Another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones.
You couldn't move the mikes like you can today, you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through.
There was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie.
In one particular scene, there is a man sitting at a table.
Someone walks right up to him and delivers their line, then walks away.
Another actor comes up from behind him, delivers their line, then walks away.
It goes on like this for a couple more people.
The microphone is obviously right by the man at the table, making for a laughable actor carousel.<br /><br />Those are only technical problems.
If you get into the story and direction, then it gets even worse.
The story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the Titanic.
The characters are unbelievable and pointless.
A \""story\"" about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie.
It is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place.
A lousy attempt at high drama, the actors take long, pregnant pauses between lines many times.
It is tiresome, and you can't wait for this 90 minute (feels like 180 at least) movie to get over with.
I'm not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country, but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie, and they were portrayed as animals.
They both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats.
They were ordered to stop or be shot, and of course they didn't so they were shot.
I was appalled.<br /><br />I give this movie a 2/10.
I would have given it a 1/10 (the lowest rating possible), but I gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films, and I tried to put it into context.
If you want to see a good early sound film, check out Alfred Hitchcock's \""Blackmail\"" that also came out in the year 1929.
You will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately."""

2565_3	"There are just so many things wrong with this movie.<br /><br />To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten.
The overall movie is (mercifully) short already, but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did the miss a reference to \The Wiz\"" on that one?) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot.
In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of reworking.<br /><br />Second, it could have done without the crude humor.
The original also had some that it could have done without, but at least there it was almost an afterthought -- here, flatulence and urination abound.<br /><br />Third, the show is a little too self-aware.
The original series had that well enough, as did the first movie, but here it's just way, way too much.
The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top (and why no mention of the \""new Ursula\""?).
Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also exceed good sense.<br /><br />Fourth, a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work.
In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant (except by behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb.
Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad, and they at least do succeed on that count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there.<br /><br />All that said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough.
It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison -- he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie but wasn't here.
Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original.<br /><br />Most other performances were pretty standard, not standing out in my mind as either good or bad."""

The only redeeming thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and that wasn't all that great, just someone I recognized.
I've seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst.

11825_1	"This film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot.<br /><br />The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying \suggested by the book Silas Marner\"".
Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:<br /><br />A wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen.
One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside.
The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child.
It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before.
The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.<br /><br />In this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same.
In only one can I find a difference.
Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far.
On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story.
Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years.
This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!<br /><br />I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made.
If I was a trustee of George Eliot's I would insist on reparation.
If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor.
At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin.
Or better still removed from the archives!<br /><br />If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner.
Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's."""
11831_3	"Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7).
They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film).
The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast.
To tell the truth I was bored silly.
It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny.
There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it.
Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work.
My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one.
My daughter fell asleep half way through.
Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird.
I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything.

11391_2	"When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train.
The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring.
Its not that I don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact, it's just that in this film they are very boring.
If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you.
It is realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie."
11546_4	"Unless I'm sadly mistaken, I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video, I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors, at the end of it, and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos.
There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits, and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes.
What could make a rap group look more foolish I can't imagine.<br /><br />(spoilers) At any rate, I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version, so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series.
The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands.
Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in, then runs to the bathroom, the sink's handles turn into Freddy's hands and attack her, and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists.
From there, the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment.
<br /><br />`Larry' Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little.
Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie.
Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film.
The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists.
All of them are cynical and uncooperative, almost none believing that they really belong there at all.
Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria.<br /><br />Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger.
Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they're going through.
There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump.
There is a gigantic, worm-like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole, there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV, 
but there is also an unconvincing go-motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger's skeleton, which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard.
And one of the more groan-inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream (the one famous for sleepwalking), tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet.
Ouch.<br /><br />We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment.
Not only do we meet his mother, but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs.
In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers (most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life) to fight him.
One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the `Wizard Master,' another is `beautiful and bad' (she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk, and she has knives).
Clever, but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients, the one who can't speak, not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie, when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams (at just the right moment to save the day).
His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long, but collectively, now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.<br /><br />Altogether, this is not an entirely weak entry into the series.
The acting is pretty shoddy, but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie.
Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two  a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films.
The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil.
But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives.
But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones"

3737_3	"I think \The Best of Times\"" was a lost cause from the get go.
The initial premise (guy drops the winning touchdown pass against a rival high school team, can never seem to get over it and then tries to reunite the two teams to play again) is one of the dumbest I have ever heard.
Since Ron Shelton went on to write much better sports films I wonder if there was more to it then that.
I hope this film wasn't green lit with Shelton pitching the story as I wrote above.<br /><br />So we have the premise.
Going from there you would think, or hope, that there might be a few twists along the way to keep things lively.
No such luck.
This script follows every predictable cliché you can think of.
There isn't a moment in this film you won't see coming a mile away before the film reveals it and the ending....
well if you can't figure out the ending by the end of the first reel then you haven't paid attention or seen any other sports movie in your life.<br /><br />Robin Williams and Kurt Russell star (and bore) in the leads.
Williams is the poor schmo who dropped the big pass and Russell is the quarterback who threw the fateful pass.
Gee, do you think Russell will suit up just once more to see if he and Williams can right a wrong that the town has never forgotten? This is such a lame duck comedy with a lame duck script that one can only shake their heads wondering what might have been.
Sure there are a few chuckles and, to be honest, there is one truly funny scene.
Williams and Russell have marital problems and the wives invite them over for dinner to resolve things.
Neither guy realizes that they have been invited over on a Monday and, yes, Monday Night Football is on.
Keeping in mind that the two teams playing have a combined one victory, the men (Williams especially) try to resist the temptation to find out how the game is going.
The scene dissolves into some hilarious bits as Williams goes to check the score by using a bathroom visit as a ruse.
When he returns he coughs the score to Russell.
Later as Russell is starting to make the moves on his wife Williams wheels the television into their view from another room.<br /><br />It's an inspired and funny scene in a mostly uninspired and stupid movie."""
1631_1	"Please humour me if you will, for a minute while I read you the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box.
It says that:<br /><br />In this part of the city every street is a dead end- on every corner something to buy- in every alley another way to die- To survive you're got to be the best- just like the Alley Cat.
Alley Cat- this lady owns the night.
On the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive- Cross her and you've run out of luck.
Alley Cat- This animal is aroused.<br /><br />Now isn't that one of the most pathetic blurbs you've ever heard in your life? Whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video.
Yet unfortunately, whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of English was doing their job only too well..
the movie contained within the little plastic case IS as bad as it sounds, and then some.<br /><br />Karin Mani plays the title role, and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a) Pout like a goldfish b) Kick male butt or c) Show off her feminine 'attributes'.
No complaints about the latter, but in terms of the other two..
let's just say she isn't much of an actress, and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert.
But even Meryl Streep with Cynthia Rothrock's body (what a scary thought) would fail to save this movie.
The unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief, as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough, pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gag-inducing love scene with the interestingly named Robert Torti.
The camera-work also follows a similar path of shame, with far too many unneeded close-ups and continuity errors abound.<br /><br />The part that I think really sums this scum-bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted, and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rich-kid rapist leers at her from the box.
Not only does he get off scot-free despite the overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his Honour.
Behind bars, she then has a group shower, a lesbian crush, a couple of cat-fights and a nice, sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle.
This ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it.
I can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more T&A to the mix, and came up with this needless sub-plot as a means to achieving that end.<br /><br />Which kinds of begs the question, is this an exploitation film, or a serious drama? Neither, is my response to that..
it isn't sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of Troma-style cinema, and it certainly doesn't make the grade as an exploration of one woman's fight against the system..
purely because it is so appallingly made.

The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric.
There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims, but it was never scary for a second.

2615_2	"I don't know why, but for some sick reason, I think since I've been on the Disney sequel binge, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations.
The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, it seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb.
I think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults.
This was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids, but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film.
And 102 Dalmations's story isn't really that good.<br /><br />Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being.
But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed.
But when she sees her probation officer's Dalmatians, she goes crazy and starts seeing spots, and she looses it.
She's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that Dalmation coat she's always wanted.<br /><br />Glenn Close is such an amazing actress, very under rated, but her taking on Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's face it, this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case.

The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical.
Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks.
The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie.
That's too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically \good\"" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands."""
6117_1	"I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but personally I think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it, and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only \serious\""
 film I recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through.
Once we reached the infamous (and interminable) snake fight scene, I think everyone gave up.<br /><br />The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting.
Oh, and there's also Bo's breasts, although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesn't rate much more than a Playboy pictorial.<br /><br />The \""dramatic tension\"" in this film is between Bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction.
The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent \""action\"" sequences ever filmed.
However, this is one of those films that's bad enough, it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor.
Definitely the worst film I ever paid to see."""

9290_4	"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened Alcatraz.
He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose.
There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself.
Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same.
But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke.
But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage.
<br /><br />Steven Seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel,
 the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.
) But there's a reason he hasn't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners.
Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it.
It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along.

9288_4	"Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B-hit.
Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something.
It's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects.
But it's although worthy a look.
If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels, even if they are direct or not.<br /><br />Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below the average, I think he isn't made to the job.
Kurupt is a good comedian, I say.
The rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing far from alright.<br /><br />Technical details, well, a production made by Sony can't be great.
Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable.
Whatever, just watch it if you want.

3709_1	"First off, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock.
I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary.
The Biggest Sack of Crap ever.
In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a Comedy Building called the Apollo.
On his way home from a gig, while riding his BIKE he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a Truck.
A little while later, he chooses the body of an old, white, and selfish millionaire.
Then, he dresses up like the music group Outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a Jockey.
Second, he goes back to the Apollo, and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black.
Do you get my drift? This movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap.
Just take my advice, don't even watch this movie."
5394_4	"I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it.
If it's using the original words in an updated setting, that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles, eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively.
It could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeare's text.
Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show.
<br /><br />Another problem is Branagh himself.
I agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important, he's such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time.
Of course he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students.
Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King, thus an unimposing so-called King with no Kingly attributes.
<br /><br />The amount of song and dance, which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing, unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically.
So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection, and I got very bored, including with the comic turns, and was glad when it ended.
Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production.<br /><br />Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older couple."
11995_4	"I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November! It looked awesome and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together.
It has a multi cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film.
I think the director, Nikhil Advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him.
Compared to Nikhil's directorial Debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' , 'Salaam-e-Ishq' falls quite behind.
I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast.
I think the best factors of this film is the songs! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years.
I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar.
I found this extremely rude watching this with family! Although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents! I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think its an alright movie!"

5997_3	"'Thunderbirds' was an immensely popular Sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now, with both adults and children alike, as it was in its heyday.
So, one would deduce the chance to produce a live-action feature film with a million pound Hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'Spider-Man' and 'The X-Men'.
But a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies' section.
<br /><br />Instead of a film focusing on the five Tracey sons, their father and trusty geek Brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains, our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteen-year-old Alan Tracey, fourteen-year-old Tin-tin and ten-year-old brain-box Fermat, son of Brains (yes, Brains' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish).
As one can tell from a run-through of our three lead characters, this 2004 remake 'Thunderbirds' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age-range as those involved in the much superior revival of 'Spider-Man' did.
The plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter pre-teens.
The scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'Spy Kids' (which was at least quirky and original) instead of remaking the show people know and love.
<br /><br />Although Sophia Myles and Ron Cook were excellent as Miss Penelope and Parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt.
Bill Paxton's Jeff Tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four Tracey boys while Anthony Edwards and Ben Kingsley, as Brains and the Hood respectively, were just embarrassing.
The Hood, in particular, is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy, two-bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce.
<br /><br />Brady Corbet, who plays Alan Tracey, may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for Vanessa Anne Hutchinson as Tin-tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for 'Girl Power'.
Ironically, it is young Soren Fulton's Fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as Fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.
<br /><br />'Thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances! 'Thunderbirds' the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop."

Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen.
\Slipstream\"" is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say 'What's going on?'.<br /><br />This is a movie where, in one scene, a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left.
This is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls.
This is a movie where a man starts talking about \""Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers\"" only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself (and then disappear into thin air).
<br /><br />This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so, as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all.
<br /><br />I must, however, commend Mr Hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie (some of whom portray multiple characters).
All of those involved throw themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they're actually doing.
My favourite here was Christian Slater's thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the American national anthem.
<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that's possibly the best way to sum up \""Slipstream\"".
It's a joke on the audience.
You'll watch it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer never actually does.
What the punchline to this particular joke is, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know.<br /><br />I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I'm a big fan of that particular director.
I would guess that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for the likes of \""Twin Peaks\"", \""Blue Velvet\"" and \""Lost Highway\"".
However, \""Slipstream\"" isn't as satisfying as any of the movies of Lynch despite imitating many of his techniques (although I was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in \""Slipstream\"").
It's far too chaotic and random - as another reviewer here pointed out, it's the movie version of Alzheimer's disease.

776_1	I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7.
My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall.
I remember that it really sucked.
The plot had no sense.
I hated the fox that became Casper's friend.
He was so stupid! Casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend.
So what? Get over it! The only good part and I don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end.
I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much.
The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost.
I wish he had stayed dead.
I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it.
No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall.
If you have a child don't let them watch this.
They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
6369_3	"The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine.
The article made this film look interesting.
Well, it isn't.
This was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie.
All the actors in this movie are awful, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a joy to watch.
But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and Duilio Marzio.
Marzio has such a thick Argentinean accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says.
Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest to Gina Phillips.
The bottom line: this movie is not scary.
There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie.
I would have given this one star, but I gave it three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much.
But even she wasn't that great in this."
3197_3	"After apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss, Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, III, is assigned the task of taking the killer back to Italy.
On the way, however, the plane is diverted to Malta.
Not long after landing, the killer escapes.
Now, and with little help from the Maltese police, Deputy Sheriff Geronimo is out to recapture a murderer.
But will his \shoot first, take names later\"" brand of Texas justice work in a foreign country? <br /><br />Let me get this out right up front, I've seen Final Justice both with and without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary.
I've seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole.
And I've seen the cut-up TV version that was used for MST3K.
Having said that, I've got to admit that I much prefer the MST3K version.
Why? Because Final Justice is one lousy movie.
The MST3K commentary helps make it much more palatable.
On its own, it's a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue (often delivered with such thick Italian accents that it's impossible to understand), bad acting, weak direction, gigantic plot holes, and most everything else you'll find in a bad movie.
And if most of Final Justice wasn't \""so bad, it's good\"", it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else.
So, yes, I enjoy the often very funny MST3K commentary over the bad movie on its own.<br /><br />My main sticking points with the MST3K commentary and with most of the reviews I've read on Final Justice, however, involve the criticisms of Joe Don Baker.
The main weaknesses in Baker's performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction.
Instead, I think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place.
Joe Don Baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor, but he's not the kind of guy I would call an \""action hero\"" by any stretch of the imagination.
He's more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of James Bond movies.
Or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with Final Justice, point your finger at director Greydon Clark.
Clark's resume can't begin to compare with Baker's.
So I say, \""Lay off Joe Don Baker!\"""""
10862_3	"I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.<br /><br />I watched several documentaries about him.
He is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director.
Definitely NO! A complete anti-talent.
He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors  never!<br /><br />He can't direct nor write.
His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word \art\"" in any sense.
No way.
Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like.
To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.<br /><br />Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store.
WHO IS HE KIDDING?<br /><br />He is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want.
He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising.
Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.<br /><br />Just look at Julio Medem.
If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can, then I might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them."""

10352_4	"I only recently found out that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD.
The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.<br /><br />Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well cast, with a likable (if too pretty) Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating.
<br /><br />The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene.
Unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart.
Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years.
For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction.
I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier.
Mrs Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here.
I could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films.
What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it's sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves."
11467_2	"Many have stated that Orca  Killer Whale is a Jaws rip-off.
This is not really true, though the enormous commercial success of Jaws undoubtedly made these man .vs.
beast stories more attractive propositions for film-makers in the second half of the '70s.
Orca  Killer Whale would be better described as a modern-day retread of Moby Dick.
It's a story about obsession.
On one hand a whale's obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate; on the other a bounty hunter's obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives.
Sadly, Orca- Killer Whale emerges a very disappointing film, its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting.<br /><br />Shark hunter Nolan (Richard Harris) encounters a marine-life researcher Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling) diving off the Atlantic coast of Canada.
Their meeting almost ends in disaster when Rachel's team are attacked by a Great White Shark, but a Killer Whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark.
After this, Nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a Killer Whale and selling it to an aquarium.
But his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on.
Rachel tells Nolan that a Killer Whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human.
Worse still, native Umilak (Will Sampson) warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge.
Nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident, but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that Nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it.
Eventually Nolan is forced to pursue the Killer Whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the Arctic Ocean, where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other.<br /><br />Two things stand out in this film.
One is the haunting score by Ennio Morricone (perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all-time, his talents wasted on various tenth-rate clunkers during the 70s and 80s).
The other is the amazing widescreen photography of Ted Moore, which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye.
In every other department, Orca  Killer Whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew.
Harris appears extremely ill throughout the film, his hair bedraggled, black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale.
His performance lacks the usual vitality.
Rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long-winded and ill-informed explanations about the ways of whales.
The rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles, the most memorable of which sees Bo Derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale.
The plot is total nonsense from start to finish, with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery! Although it's credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions, the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd.
Orca  Killer Whale is really one for completists of the man .vs.
beast cycle from the late 70s.
Most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair."
10521_1	"This movie is a terrible waste of time.
Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4.
I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose.
This is also a \horror\"" film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight.
My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared.<br /><br />The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries.
It cannot be that high in demand.

11173_4	"If it wasn't for the bad dialogues and script.
I mean, the direction was really in touch with it's subject.
The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life.
But in the end, the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together.
I would highly suggest not to watch this.
Unless you're a Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and will watch everything he is playing in.
Even if the result lately are rather poor.
This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles."
4893_1	"The movie is actually too slow.
There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring.
You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more.
It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all.
Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun.
To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie.
They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad.
Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it.
Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music.
The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost.
Personally I cannot recommend the movie.
I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring.
During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review."
11249_4	"Visually stunning? Most definitely.
I have seen few films look this good in some time.
Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography, computer graphics, and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh.
The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s.
The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason.
Also, mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide.
Who can stop them and save the world? Alright, it doesn't take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead, and in the wings his trusty, thoroughly competent sidekick.
What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization.
The plot for this film is ridiculous.
That being said, the film is going for a serial-like feeling of film serials of yesteryear.
They had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and big names this film had.
Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat, one would think, but Sky Captain sinks miserably.
Despite its fantastic dark look, I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life.
I had little interest in a story that generated little interest.
I didn't care at all for any of the glib portrayals.
Paltrow was just awful.
Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance.
Law cannot carry the one-liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders.
I mean, let's face it, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes.
The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little.
I was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came."

7744_1	"Well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that I signed up for an IMDb account just to warn people.
It is patently AWFUL!! NOTHING makes sense in this movie.
There is way too many subplots for a start.
Josh Hartnett's character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls (Some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work).
Add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo.
Harrison Ford's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the Internal Affairs investigator's ex-wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which Ford's character calls from time to time.
NONSENSE!!<br /><br />I can't remember the characters names (that's how forgettable this is) so I'll refer to them as Ford and Hartnett.<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue which is brutal.
I mean cringe-inducing stuff here.
Throw in every cliché in the book (having a heart-to-heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name; the duo being investigated by internal affairs (why??); hartnett confronting his dad's killer) and you've got one hell of a mess.
<br /><br />As I mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non-existent: 1) When Ford's car is being repossessed, how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked? Were they following him?? 2) When Hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene (an earring) is replicated on of the charred bodies there (that was lucky!) 3) When the two are arrested and taken in for questioning - Ford keeps answering his phone and Hartnett \centers himself\"" with a yoga pose on the table.
Instead of taking the phone from Ford the IA guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before Ford does.
Meanwhile the female IA officer in with Hartnett is rubbing herself all over him.
Then, inexplicably, the two are released without answering any questions.
4) During the car chase Hartnett's car is crashing and smashing its way around Hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again.
Not a scratch! 5) When Ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at?? 6) When the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett's car, Ford is trying to close a real estate deal.
Come on! 7) The bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever.
His motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label? They might leave his label and it's a warning to keep his other groups loyal.
But hang on, how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan?? 8) Why is the IA guy who is investigating Ford arrested in the end? There is no explication!! 9) And Hartnett gets to use his \""acting\"" to capture the bad guy in the end.<br /><br />I could go on, I really could.
Anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that's all it is.
There's nothing else to it! It's not supposed to be satirical or ironic.
It's just crap."""
332_1	"I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it.
I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site.
I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase.
Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity.
That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad.
The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam.
The acting isnt much better.
I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos.
Yay, who cares...
Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser.
That's about as much of the plot as I understood.<br /><br />Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen.

3216_2	"Witty.
Quirky.
Genuine.
Surreal.
Butterfly wings? One could ask what all of these words best describe, and some (those in fuse with the international film community) may quickly say Happenstance, but others may jump aboard the more American train and immediately yell, The Butterfly Effect.
Strangely, I would be one of those screaming for that sci-fi Kutcher film mainly because none of those words that I initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the Tautou feature that I witnessed.
Sure, we all loved her in Amelie and thought she was the daughter of Jesus in The Da Vinci Code, but in this film first-time director (of a feature film at least) Laurent Firode doesn't give Tautou the opportunity to shine.
Sadly, he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of \random chance\"" to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer (never a true boil).
Firode has ample, and I use \""ample\"" as a small word, moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story, a genuinely whimsical fairy-tale of love and coincidence, but instead he fell face-first into a mud-bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.
<br /><br />Tautou's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box, but do not be so taken immediately as I did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into Tautou's French cinema.
Tautou is in this film, do not get me wrong, but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story.
Firode's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly (albeit confusing) ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing \""melodrama\"".
He utterly, utterly fails.
Firode fails by giving us, the audience, too many characters.
With too many characters he gives us too many random interventions, and by the end you don't really care who is who, or what is what, or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival.
Tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only Firode would have given her the center.
Alas, he did not, but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny.
It just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.<br /><br />Firode fails because he focus' so intently on the minor details that, for one of those rare film occurrences, he actually forgets the central focus.
I can say that there was no defined central focus to Happenstance.
In the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight, but we never go back to that throughout the film.
Instead, again, we are bombarded with new characters, stuffy scenes, and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of \""ifs, ands, and buts\"".
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't believe this film.
Writer Firode (yes, the same guy directing this garbage) uses a technique so primitive in this film that I immediately felt like ending it immediately.
He must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline (or the scientific premise) because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks.
I didn't need this, nor do I think Firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter.
While there were other elements that just didn't seem to work for me at all (again, felt like a jumbled Parisian collage of shredded paper), this was the icing on the cake.
I don't need my hand held through films.<br /><br />I will give this film one star for credit.
This is a rather difficult genre to master successfully.
Time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for, but with Happenstance it works because Firode semi-explores the different avenues.
While I will counter with saying that he does not do it well, it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment.
I liked where Firode was headed with this film, he had a genuinely diagramed story, but the final execution just blew this film to shreds.
Firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters, while lightening up his premise and story.
I think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken.
Oh, how I only wish I could time travel back to the production of this film to show Firode the errors of his ways.<br /><br />Overall, for the first time (and probably last), this was a Tautou film that I must say utterly disappointed me.
From the choppy opening to the apathetic ending, I just felt that Happenstance failed due to Firode's leadership and horrid marketing.
Marketing is something that I didn't mention before, but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an Amelie 2 (per the title released in Hong Kong), and why would you place Tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all.
I believe that from the first minute that passed on my DVD player, this film was in shambles.
While I will applaud his subject, everything else was well below the level of mediocrity.
I cannot suggest this film to anyone.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****"""
9462_1	"Inappropriate.
The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA.
Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please.
Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake.
There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.
<br /><br />But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie.
The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces.
The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this.
The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning.
Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.
<br /><br />Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable.
I didn't like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again.
His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.
<br /><br />In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.

Anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that I'm pretty easy to please.
I really didn't think I'd end up feeling this negatively towards it.
<br /><br />The plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can become one with a good dragon or something I don't know.
It was so stupid, I didn't bother to put much effort into retaining it.
<br /><br />It features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts.
So many of the events just felt totally random and sudden.<br /><br />I assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it's trying to be so grand and epic, yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly.
I feel like I've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball.
The film is like a punch in the face.
It doesn't take much time at all to establish characters or drama.
Imagine the \Lord of the Rings\"" trilogy in 90 minutes You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no buildup and you'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles.
That was the case with Dragon Wars 90 minutes of me not giving a crap, waiting for it to be over.
<br /><br />Fantastic CGI with some okay directing, but horrible acting, speedy pacing, and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds.
I probably would have loved it when I was 6."""
11606_4	Decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things.
<br /><br />I also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff.

7319_4	"when you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt...
try not to gag on a fur ball.<br /><br />I like Albert Brooks.
I've seen most, if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one.
Modern Romance is an interesting take on the subject of love.
There are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as Modern Romance, although 1979's Chilly Scenes of Winter comes very close.
They both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted/obsessed to their respective women.<br /><br />Where-as Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on the subject stalking, this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship..
and out of the relationship..
and back in it again.<br /><br />And because it's a movie that was released in 1981, it is of its time in terms of styles and such.
That's the main reason I like this movie.
My basic rule when it comes to movies is \If it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance\"", you know time capsule stuff.
<br /><br />Which leads me to the horrific scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt.
<br /><br />The man is hair.
Very hair.
Like he's wearing a black curly fur sweater-hairy.
And what's worse is he almost looks burn victim-hairy.
It's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on.
Back in the early 80's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking.
But in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting.
Sorry, Albert! I wish at some point someone said \""hey let's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t-shirt, I mean you might scare people\"".
It's just really bad and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with Albert Brooks naked body on top of hers.
She was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that.<br /><br />Anyway, it's an OK movie.
It could have been better if I hadn't see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie."""

7432_4	"One of the weaker Carry On adventures sees Sid James as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills.
The fourth of the series to be hospital-based, it's possibly the least of the genre.
There's a curiously flat feel throughout, with all seemingly squandered on below-par material.
This is far from the late-70s nadir, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al.
are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability.<br /><br />Most of the gags are onrunning, rather than episodic as Carry Ons usually are.
So that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio, if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film.
These continuous plot strands include Williams  for no good reason  worrying that he's changing sex, and Kenneth Cope in drag.
Like the stagy physical pratt falls, the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies, and lacking in cast interest.
Continuing this theme, Matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format, largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour.
In fact, the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of Terry and June ...
so it's appropriate that Terry Scott is present, mugging futilely throughout.
<br /><br />Some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic, such as this between Scott and Cope: \What about a little drink?\"" \""Oh, no, no, I never touch it.\"" \""Oh.
Cigarette then?\"" \""No, I never touch them.\"" \""That leaves only one thing to offer you.
\"" \""I never touch that either.\"" That said, while a funny man in his own right (livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) no end), you do feel that Cope isn't quite tapped in to the self-parodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier.
This does actually happen, in part, though only for the last fifteen minutes.
<br /><br />Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce, but lacks the irony to carry it off.
That said, Williams's description of premarital relations is priceless: \""You don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room, you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first!\"" \""That may be so,\"" counters Jacques, \""but you're not going to stick me up against a wall.
\"" Williams really comes to life in his scenes with Hattie, and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.
<br /><br />Carry On Matron is not a bad film by any means, just a crushingly bog-standard one."""
5642_1	"This title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public.
For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it.
I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin.<br /><br />Try to fit this film into a genre and you won't, because it lacks a beginning, middle or ending.
I've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless.<br /><br />I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group.
No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us.
That is if you can call it erotic.
It certainly didn't have taste."
10701_4	"Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt, with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong, independent lady-flier who's never been in love.
Intriguing early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, playing an Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix who's been too self-involved to give herself over to any man.
The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view, but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the type of simpering, weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another bummer.
A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate-watchers.

6860_2	"beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there.
<br /><br />The characters basically make no sense most of the time.
<br /><br />The film has no real beginning, middle or ending, nor is anything ever explained much.
<br /><br />The film opens with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from a stint in the army.
<br /><br />He hitches a ride to a two story house that is in extreme disrepair, windows boarded over.
He goes in the house, walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there.
This scene comes to nothing, and we learn nothing further about the house or its history.
<br /><br />It is never explained exactly whose house this is, or where the people have gone, but we are given the impression Hazel has probably lived there at one time.
<br /><br />Hazel decides to go to a city.
Why - we don't know.
Once he arrives in this city he writes down a name & address that he sees on a bathroom wall, and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat hooker.
He sees her for awhile and then he apparently isn't seeing her anymore.
Like everything else in this movie, it comes to nothing and serves no purpose.
<br /><br />A young man named Enoch, tries to befriend him, but Hazel really isn't interested, although they keep crossing paths.
<br /><br />Enoch is about as crazy as you can get.
One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly.
<br /><br />We never really know why Enoch behaves as he does, or why Hazel behaves as he does, beyond the fact Hazel had an overdose of old time scary, fundamentalist religion via his grandfather.
<br /><br />Enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit, and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it.
<br /><br />Hazel, who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching.
I got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him.
<br /><br />He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never really make any particular point, and there is no plot line.
<br /><br />Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins self-harming.
<br /><br />It is a very odd film.
Interesting in it's oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it.
<br /><br />The cast does an outstanding job,but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline.
<br /><br />The film also has the characters tossing around the N word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog.<br /><br />2 stars"

10486_3	"My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really.
I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good.
Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales.
This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by.what else.extortion.
As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas.
Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer.
Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important.
It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense.
The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short.
Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one Don't say I didn't warn you!"

It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be.
Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.<br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.
<br /><br />There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma.
Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill.
The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.<br /><br />However, there are several major problems.
The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr.
Knightley.
This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson.
It's badly out of tune.<br /><br />The second problem is one of length.
Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.<br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation.
Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already.
It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly.
Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise.
First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy.
More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast.
What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel.

5377_3	"The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'Club 905' owned & run by Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker).
Lead singer Dylan (Sean Cook) & guitar player Mike (Jason McKee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) & drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer.
Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster.
Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one...
<br /><br />Produced & directed by Juan A.
Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it.
The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it.
As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on.
Then there's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious.
The kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor.
<br /><br />Director Mas does alright, the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping.
The gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles.
Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything.
Since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it.
I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution.
It's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look.
Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently.
The acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad.<br /><br />The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies.
I mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what's the point? Those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for, right?"

3296_1	"Film makeovers of old TV shows seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days, but this disrespectful, toilet humor, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth foul language, rip-off is a blatant middle finger to all Dukes of Hazzard fans both north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line.
From the opening sequence of Bo and Luke Duke making a moonshine run for Uncle Jesse (no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation) to the closing sequence of Uncle Jesse smoking weed with the Governor of Georgia (Uncle Jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways) this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult.
I can't tell you how many parents I saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived.
The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a family show with basic moral values.
The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a kid safe, Hemi powered, show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids George Carlin's seven words.
I have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist.
Those commits might be correct about the movie.
Those commits are ABSOLUTELY incorrect about the show.
The show, if anything, was about how to get along and be friends with ANYONE.
Hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us, Yankee, Rebel, or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing.
Hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul mouthed, trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell.
Prove the Hollywood Elitist that they are wrong.
DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE.
Boycott the sponsors.
Fill Warner Bros.
email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest T.V.
shows of all time.

2227_1	"Every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks \What's with SNITCH'D\"" ? I know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror.
You see, I was the cinematographer on the film.<br /><br />Let me clarify some points regarding this \""interesting life experience\"".
<br /><br />Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT.
I met James Cahill in July of 1999, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG's notorious Experimental Feature contract.
But I digress...<br /><br />I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $25,000, not wanting to break pace, I took it.
After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI...
I too believed the myth back then.<br /><br />Let's just chalk it up as \""film school\"" for many involved, myself included.
SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August, 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA.
Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes, he is a Drama and English teacher...consider THAT while watching the film, or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast.
<br /><br />Of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L.A.'s Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt.
I must say her professional dedication, focus and \""let's do this\"" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come.
<br /><br />SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication.
None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself.
<br /><br />Anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to lend credibility to SNITCH'D.
Since Cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it's cover...
as so many have picked up this DVD based on it's sleeve.
----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent.
<br /><br />6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico.
I though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was...
a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN."""
5436_2	"A friend of mine gave me this movie.
A friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a DVD casing from his ***.
<br /><br />I got quit excited by the prospects of an other Michael Chabon movie.
After all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great, but boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />First off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so.
I imagine the castings went something like this.
\Tell me, do you like fish?\"" \""Yes I enjoy fish very much.\"" \""Wonder full, you're hired.
Have some money.\"" <br /><br />Than there is the script.
I have read Chabon, who I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel.
I'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did, but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out.
<br /><br />This is an actual line from the movie; \""If you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before, than this moment becomes unique!\"" Unique? Does it? Does it really? Off course not you plank.
Please pass me the Imodium.
I'll have a whole ****ing strip.
<br /><br />The directing is...
well.
I've got nothing.
Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something.
Stick to directing comedies.
No stick to directing commercials.
<br /><br />This movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age.
I give it 2 stars because I don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie."""
1021_1	"The movie started off strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt.
Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the Practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder.
Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience.
The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.<br /><br />The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced.
Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former.
Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him.
I would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years.
Everything he did in this film was unconvincing.<br /><br />Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films.
Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.<br /><br />That aside there are a few plot holes, such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery.
This movie had so much promise.
Thoroughly disappointing."
9330_2	"Saw this movie recently and had higher hopes.
Not so much based upon the director, who hadn't made a cinematographic release before, but more based upon its cast.
Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (lead role in Body double, a Brian De Palma masterpiece) have all starred in great movies.
Not together though, and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this one.
<br /><br />The film is unbelievable, very predictable and cliché.
The only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it's been shot.
In my humble opinion: don't waste your time on this one."
11726_4	"Wesley Snipes is James Dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the CIA and pure bad-ass special operative.
During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.
<br /><br />Enter agent Collins, his supervising officer.
Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody.
Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.
<br /><br />The assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew.
So Dial's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.
<br /><br />Fortunately for Dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement...
<br /><br />With a script like that need I say more? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging.
On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach."
3115_2	"I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time felt complied to.
Night Listener is without doubt one of the dullest films I have ever seen.
<br /><br />There was nothing happening in this film what so ever - I didn't care for any of the characters, didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot, didn't care how it ended....nothing.
<br /><br />There is no comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, nothing.
The highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn.
<br /><br />I really enjoyed \One Hour Photo\"" and hoped for a similar eerie role from Williams, but alas was sorely let down.
What's more disappointing is that I'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me.
<br /><br />I might even have given it 1/10 but that score is reserved for the remake of The Producers"""
7752_3	"The film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt.
Since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off.
The deaths are cheesy and are dumb.
But at least it had better effects then sabretooth.
I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth.
I thought it was okay but some deaths were off-screen.
There was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out.
Then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off.
The end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics.
Even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts doesn't find them, and seems like she doesn't need the.
The film is idiotic and a waste of time."
11991_3	"- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap.
Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \The Twilight Zone\"".
The flashbacks are pretty much useless.
One part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better"
6204_1	"Violence whether real or not always has an impact.
In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for.
In the Great Ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of.
But what was the point? The violence looks like a mix of Noë's 'Irreversible, and ' Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange'...both of which are remarkable films.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to screen violence at all and I've seen some nasty stuff in my film-going years, but this film as a whole is totally juvenile.
The story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence, the rizla paper thin reason we are give for Robert's demise is his introduction to drugs.
Danny Dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for Robert's drug fuelled demise, however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes.
Lesley Manville is Robert's unable to cope mum, I am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber.
The acting is wooden, the scene in the kitchen with the TV-cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale- who wrote those dialogues?! Some of the comments the boys make...'looks like she's enjoying it' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for Clay's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals.
Why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery...one can only wonder at this young man's psychology.
<br /><br />The 'political meaning' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes; in the bar, outside the TV-cook's house, war in Iraq reports, was perhaps too obvious in my opinion.
Yes, war is violent, social determinism causes frustration, we're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping E.
Juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man.
This issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film.
<br /><br />My opinion: derivative, badly-made and pointless."
7770_1	"This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go.
As I was nearing the end of The Cold I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60's shocker.
The story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games.
Whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win $1,000,000.
It's a very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible.
Things happen.
Characters are completely forgotten about.
Nothing makes too much sense.
And then it ends.
Weirdly.
I mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions.
Production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard.
In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) isn't even that good.
She is so unbelievably terrible she's compelling.
Sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap-fest as a whole, it's just a bargain basement rotter."
561_1	"Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think.
First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all.
The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues.
The audience was laughing many times.
And the suspense is very low.
Actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments.
The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like \I want to *beep* you \"" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all.
That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone.
From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie.
For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly.
The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows.
The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows.
The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas.
There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it.
The film looks cheap and badly edited at times.
I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: \""Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?\"" All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this.
The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema.
It was provoking, sexy and controversial.
It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career.
It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style.
Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories.
It's a pity that they made this film."""
1927_2	"(possible spoilers)<br /><br />Someone once asked Dr.
Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr.
T).
When the good Dr.
died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights.
But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs.
Geisel had a change of heart.
Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character.
Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result.
Well, Mrs.
Geisel, that makes one of us.<br /><br />The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are undermined
<br /><br />somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography).
Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S.
Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much better<br /><br />use of a high budget) turned in.
Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch.
It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight.
So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr.
Grinch is directly because of the Whos.
Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story.
That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy.
The character that Dr.
Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart.
Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger<br /><br />(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked).
This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).
<br /><br />The Whoville of Dr.
Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas.
The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism.
This is offensively<br /><br />hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising<br /><br />campaign.
<br /><br />The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original.
The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character).
She<br /><br />seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.<br /><br />Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their<br /><br />stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film.
It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,<br /><br />manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart.
The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today.
Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!"
9872_2	"Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable.
starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere.
Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces.
A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget.
The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service.
Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade.
Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads.
I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all.
The movie I kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much.
Unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one.
Oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery"
55_1	"There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and \The Man who Fell to Earth.\"" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school.
The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence.
It completely lost me with the \""hillarious\"" gag of someone getting shot in the butt.
Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic.
Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble.
The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's.
I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You.
This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing.
The worst."""
4720_1	"When I saw this \documentary\"", I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again.
Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup, it is not mentioned in this \""documentary\"", which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective.
It is one in the set of lies pushed by Milosevic regime.
Everyone else is guilty only Serbians were right and victims, even though most of the War Criminals tried in Hague are Serbs, even though Serbs are one who have committed genocide against Bosnians , and attacked Slovenia, Croatia,and Bosnia all independent nations recognized by the UN.Breakup of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because Serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on Federal Yugoslav government, so SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests.If you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of Yugoslavia, and fact led documentary this is not it .

I would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid \""Deceiver\"" because you will be very frustrated.
Maybe I am just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending.
Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense.

9801_1	"I remember this show being on the television when I was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs.
It was called power rangers.
I remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.<br /><br />I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids.
Most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why.
The footage is ridiculous at best.
The colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense.
Then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts.
All the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.
<br /><br />The toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts.
And of course two of the worst movies ever made, and I do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on.
<br /><br />Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising.
As an adult, I don't look at it fondly, but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows, fashion and guys' earrings."

I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD.
However, I couldn't get into this story because its two main characters: \David\"" (Bruce Willis) and \""Maddie\"" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to in love with themselves, for one thing.
I admit was some clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I did appreciate of lot of that dialog.
<br /><br />Basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female.
You get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming.
A lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering, but I hate it, so I never got on the Moonlighting bandwagon.

7719_3	"The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire.
The target of the satire is quite vast, from the US Government to corporate America.
It is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.
<br /><br />Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie, Airplane and Police Squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny.
I can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's.
I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks.
<br /><br />The plot is simple enough.
Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go \crazy\"" and start attacking people and cities.
At first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.
<br /><br />The movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : Lois \""Fairchild\"" (a Lois Lane clone), a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who hasn't worked since the Bay of Pigs), a useless President (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), an even inept Congress, a sleazy marketing CEO, and Mason's team consisting of an obese East German \""female\"" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed WWII paratrooper and an African-American disguise expert (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato).
Did I also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.
<br /><br />On top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well.
They aren't that good and seem to be dubbed.
The best tune is by far the theme of the movie (\""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\"").
It is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public.
Be warned.<br /><br />Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres.

Don't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through.<br /><br />The plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake.
The camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least.

I figured out who Lenny was about half hour in when I figured out the movie.
I was so visually under whelmed and confused by the Lenny reveal that I completely felt ripped off.

The Punch-Dance.
Rod \needs to go to his quiet place\"" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of Europe.<br /><br />2.
John Farnham's You're The Voice.
In one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag.
How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A major Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it leveled mountains in Switzerland.<br /><br />Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit.<br /><br />Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump.
Maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness.
Or his fake mustache.

1293_4	"I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film.
Thought visually stunning like all of Ang Lee's work (each still frame seems worthy of a print), I was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace.
It really was too long.<br /><br />The story is set in Civil War era Missouri, and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers, sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts.
He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned, presumably by Jayhawkers.
The story follows Roedel's and Chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war, including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright), and a war widow played by Jewel.
<br /><br />It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped.
For example, the agitation among Roedel's group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol, and then dropped until later in the movie.
A young villian/bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him, but, we never know why.
Some of the characters never seem to surface; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.<br /><br />The historical detail was excellent.
I loved looking at the housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, though they stumbled a bit with the dialog.
Unless you really enjoy history or are a huge Ang Lee fan, though, take a pass on this one."

Speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the Diet Coke in the 64 oz.

The most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning.
But rather than explore the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other.
When they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together....with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there.

5811_3	"I have not seen this movie in ages but figured I'd comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells.
The original THE GETAWAY was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens, 3) Was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.
<br /><br />By comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, Kim Basinger.
McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the Baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.
<br /><br />Let's just get it said and out of the way -- Alec Baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role.
Like someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre.
By contrast Baldwin, Bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsen's and James Woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.<br /><br />The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words.
One viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made.
Peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing.
There's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.<br /><br />So I don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing.
I'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie & fall flat with something original.
This movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release Mr.
Baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood.

9588_4	"\Absolute Beginners\"" was a film for the younger generation, a multi-time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in Britain and how these troubled, constantly hitting each note, teen's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow.
It could have been dubbed the \""Moulin Rouge\"" of the 80s, but it disappeared.
It made its very shallow mark on the world, snuck under the radar, and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section, the comedy section, or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn't need chain money to survive.
Alas, that wasn't where I found it  but I found it, watched it, tried my hardest to sing along with it, stared into Bowie's eyes, but found myself faded by the end.
Did it not survive the test of time? Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society? Is Bowie too creepy? I think \""Absolute Beginners\"" falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang, but withers to a mere sparkle by the end.
<br /><br />\""Absolute Beginners\"" opens with a huge number that takes us through the non-gritty streets of London which involve theft nightly, prostitutes on every corner, dance throughout, booze like rivers, and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual.
Sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right? Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters.
The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie O'Connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl, Suzette (played by Patsy Kensit).
These two have chemistry, and while Suzette looks like a pre-rehab Lohan, to me they worked.
There was a huge spark between them, the chemistry was like lava, and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled.
I was ready  but then, something happened.
Temple takes us out of the nightlife, takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning, and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first.
Suzette runs away, Colin becomes a pervert, and Bowie  well  I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  I can tell you that much.
Temple gives us this flashy city, this opportunity to see those that inhabit it, but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger.
We learn about Colin, mainly, but nobody else.
I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom, and what importance fashion had to that era.
Also, were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s, but maybe it was my TV.<br /><br />Character development thrown right out the door, Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger, more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about.
One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example.
Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colin's parents (of which I didn't know it was them until after the film) and a song which screams apathy.
Great song, too many characters, not enough time, suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency, and it just falls apart in your hands.
Then, if that wasn't enough, we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs, rubbing our noggin' trying to understand where our characters are or are going, and Temple throws in hatred, anger, and politics into the final act.
While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme, I didn't think racism would be on the top of the bill.
Suddenly, friends are missing, people are angry, and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race? Somebody help me out here.
It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off.
To me, the ending of \""Absolute Beginners\"" was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number.
That first part set the pace, and Temple could not keep up.<br /><br />Overall, I must say that Temple can direct a music video, but I don't think he was quite prepared for the feature film.
I don't think this film will ever make it into full \""cult\"" status, and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come.
It is a fun film to watch initially, but when we get to that final part, it just explodes from the inside.
I wanted some cutting edge work, but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for.
I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s, but by the end it just felt forced.
I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to \""Motivation\"" by the ever-freaky Bowie in this film, it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status.
I am glad that I watched this film once, but that is all that my small brain can take.
I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning, but he couldn't control his characters (way too many), and the songs didn't seem to match the final moments of the film.
It came out of nowhere, and it was unwelcomed.
If this was a film about racism, it needed to be from the beginning.
\""Absolute Beginners\"" was a welcomed adventure, but I don't think I will be dusting this film off in the future.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****"""
9692_2	"Bonjour Tristesse covers similar ground as 'The Member of the Wedding.'

While critics love 'Member of the Wedding,' I find Julie Harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she's been in.
This portrays irritating, rich idiots as in Last Year at Marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue.<br /><br />In this Preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not.
For the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible.
Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires.
Kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'Endless Love.'
Seberg's vacuous narration, is like something out of Strange Interlude - it is not good.
I really wish someone other than Niven was in his role.
He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.<br /><br />In the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a harbor.
Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, 'The Conformist.'
Kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain (as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven Knows Mr.

7402_2	"This is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie.
On one hand the imagery, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly \expensive\"" look and feel.
Even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot.<br /><br />In this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all.<br /><br />So 50% of the dialog consists of \""What the hell was that ?\"", \""What was that ?\"" and \""What the hell was that ?\"".
In none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though.
In most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them.<br /><br />The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with.
That way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to.

It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through.

The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much.
The characters in general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't do a very good job.<br /><br />The acting wasn't very good.
I wasn't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny.
Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances.

The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else.
Jessica Simpson isn't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing.
She's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things.
She is pretty but she's a weak actor.
It doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn't complex or anything.
Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he doesn't do anything special.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by John O'Brien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard.
The first one was Cradle to the Grave, which was okay.
The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny.
He doesn't do a good job here though as the story is a mess.
He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better.
The movie is also pretty long for a comedy.
Okay, 106 minutes isn't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there's very little humor in the first hour.
I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time.
The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes.
The car sequences were average and they don't save an already troubled film.
In the end, Dukes of Hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it's better if you just skip it.

Everyone I talk to says the same thing.
They like House's gruff nature and his intelligence, but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot.
It cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority.
It needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital.
Also, there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what Tritter is actually doing.
He alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients.
A lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray.

<br /><br />The random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and the scenes with notable actors/actresses like Gerard Butler (who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds) not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all-out over the top with their minimal lines, just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery.
<br /><br />Courtney Love's part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack-whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something.
You can't tell because she's either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically.<br /><br />Karen Black is just annoying...
randomly laughing, and screaming in such a way that irritates you.<br /><br />Helen Mirren...
she was in the original, and her return to \""Caligula\"" consists of...
\""CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"" I particularly \""love\"" (and by love, I mean hate) Ennia's line, \""Caligola...
j00 no maki me *something incoherent*....
*something that sounds like j00nalo*\"" It's also insanely arrogant to say Caligula's four year reign was greater than Jesus's birth and death.<br /><br />Honestly, this has got to be the worst, most exploitative, self-indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as \""art\"" I've ever seen.
Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he shouldn't have shown up or given his name over for this crap-pile, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen).

2276_4	"CLASS OF '61 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />In 1861, class members from the West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the Civil War.
<br /><br />Gregory Hoblit's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted, despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), toplined by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery, pitting him in direct conflict with his former Northern friends.
The movie's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is efficient rather than inspired."
7834_3	"i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers.
<br /><br />i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché, it wasn't even funny any more.
the same old stories you've probably seen/read a couple of times already - living toys, evil things from other dimensions...
and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés.
i'd prefer e.g.
\chucky\"" and \""silent hill\"" over those two episodes anytime.

the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second...
awful.

or gore...
erm...
nothing worth mentioning.<br /><br />it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen/read that many scary stories yet (although i'd rather recommend \""beyond belief\"" - now that's what i call a decent mystery TV show).

4244_1	"Contrary to my principles, let me first come up with a conclusion, because I have just seen this piece of \art\"", and still am under strong impressions.
The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary.<br /><br />Well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and I would never bother to write a single word about it, if it were not for the fact that \""44 Minutes\"" made me sick to death, which rarely happens to me.
The fact that I paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better, as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here.<br /><br />So what is wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - \""44 Minutes\"".
One first thinks about \""15 Minutes\"", which is by the way a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and indeed the two can be compared to some extent.
But, as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst characteristics.
They both feature Mr.
Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices.
His purpose is to appeal to the Cold War mind.
Ah, do we miss the good old times.
Now, I don't imply that he is a bad actor, I am yet to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype.
How anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension.
We can recognize modern American xenophobia here.
The point in the movie when Taktarov explains to his companion that Romanians are not Germans, and that they are in America is truly laughable.
Are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become \""true\"" Americans? <br /><br />Then, there is the media issue.
Yes, it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters.
The director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes.
Instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel.
In 15 Minutes the issue of media is the central one.The point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are focusing on 44 Minutes now.
So, I have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie.
What is it? To provide good time for the audience? To glorify weapons? To glorify police? Portray violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the underage delinquent.
So it must promote peace and understanding after all? I don't think so, but don't ask me.
I only know I didn't enjoy any of this.<br /><br />Ah, Michael Madsen.
I admit, I am a big fan.
I hoped he would be a bright point, but I was wrong.
It's not his fault though.
<br /><br />As the final note, comparing \""firepower\"" to \""willpower\"" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines I have ever heard.<br /><br />To summarize, on the scale 1-10, I give it a pure, unadulterated 1."""

The story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of - time slips / ghosts / a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul-thing would be explained.

5614_4	"One of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not Borat or The Departed but a 2005 documentary about Jesus Christ called The God Who Wasn't There by director Brian Flemming, an ex-Christian Fundamentalist.
Flemming, in his 62-minute documentary, asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions.
Using interviews with authors, philosophers, and historians to debunk the long-held Christian belief that Jesus, the son of God, lived among men, was crucified, and was resurrected, Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt, Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology, and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities.
<br /><br />In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults, he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story, the four gospels, were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus' crucifixion and that the letters of St.
Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure.
Flemming, unfortunately however, is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion.
Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price.
The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher, the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com, and Ronald Sipus, principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School, which Flemming attended as a boy.
<br /><br />Like Michael Moore's interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine, his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle.
In a sarcastic tone, Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth, then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser, who cut her baby's arm off for God.
He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians \look forward to the day when all non-Christians are thrown into a lake of fire, howling and screeching.\"" To further turn us against Christianity, Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture.
What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion.
In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts, he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester, a famous Christian pacifist, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice, and Mother Teresa, whose work was about respect for each individual's worth and dignity.
<br /><br />His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points, yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines, there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD, long after the New Testament.
Also it is important to note one major difference.
The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god.
This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God's will to mankind.
<br /><br />Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter.
What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind's spiritual evolution.
Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many, Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love, and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man.<br /><br />While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed, what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together.
While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects, in the words of Annie Besant, \""spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect.
The God Who Wasn't There is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others."""

10242_3	"This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together.
Well there's nothing wrong with that, except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together.
90 percent of the cast are white males about same age.
It's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves.
The movie has no plot.
It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath.
There are some funny scenes and comedic bits.
But they don't redeem the flat monotony.<br /><br />The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that.
Anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation.<br /><br />I went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece.
Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get.
Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy.
It works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over.
It's more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie.
It's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy.
I can see where the story idea is intriguing.
But, in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England.
In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era.
He plans to make a Part 2.
I guess he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.<br /><br />At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2.
He was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one, to which he replied, well yea, sure."

He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had seen it already! Actually I had seen it years before, when it was released.
At that time I didn't think it was that bad a movie.
However seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different.
Yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated.
Steve admitted it was not a very good movie.
That said he was just a little proud of 'The Proctologist' sketch."
5389_3	"If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better.
The Omega Man comes to mind.
To the studio's credit, they avoided the sprawling, unnecessary, big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk.
Additionally, the set-up and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease.
What's bad is EVERYTHING else! I get tired of endlessly stupid, careless, wimpy, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie.
That pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point.
I rented it, and found myself yelling at the TV repeatedly, \no, don't do that!\"", \""why are you so stupid\"", \""look out!\"", etcetera.
A true lack of character development is evident about halfway in.
A movie SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them.
This one does not.
Also,there should have been a longer, more involving end to the movie as well."""
3194_1	"I can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984.
It's got some laughable acting, not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever.
Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact, it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action/cop film as I can think of.<br /><br />I'm glad I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield.
They remark on the female lead's resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld (\None of them are spongeworthy\"") and riff non-stop on Baker's weight.

9104_2	"<br /><br />When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that it had been made.
Cruel Intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best teen-oriented films made in years.
This prequel had certain things incongruent with the original.
(Sebastian's father married into wealth, then why does he have a rich Aunt on long island?).
<br /><br />Then I found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep.
After hearing that, it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form.
<br /><br />I think that Roger Kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had, AFTER the series wasn't picked up by Fox.
It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 Film.
 (Which the newer ending is directed right towards.)<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that it suggested Sebastian and his father had married into the wealth, which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york, and sine Katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her,
 it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man not of her social class.
<br /><br />As a prequel this is fairly lame.
But I would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series."
9877_4	"Fantastic Mr.
Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book.
Wes Anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film.
While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit.
Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film.
Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy.
I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening.
The characters are good, also.
Jason Schwartzman voices Mr.
Fox (George Clooney)'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging.
The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along.
I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment."

This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not.
The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork).

and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up.
It turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ...
and the story progresses from there.<br /><br />While the story does pick up at that point, it really goes nowhere.
After 2 hours, I asked myself: was there a point to this, or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished.

At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there.
Also, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere.
There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go.
As far as artistic merit, there is none.
The scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film.

2697_1	"Based on the personal experiences of director John Singleton's time at the University of Southern California,comes Higher Learning.
A film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges.<br /><br />There are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story: Malik Williams, an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an African American male.
Kristin Conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and Remy, a unsophisticated unconnected white male.
All three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared (Malik), by being naive (Kristin), and by being unwanted (Remy).<br /><br />One good thing about the film is that it does show that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large.
The colleges are not places to build character , develop potential, or enhance personal advancement, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere.
It is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students.
It would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics.<br /><br />But it didn't and that's where the films falls apart.
Singleton ,it seems, had a pretty bad experience at Southern California.
Through this film he lets it all hang out.
There is no need to beat around the bush here.
Singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen.
<br /><br />The black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, save for Kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student.
<br /><br />Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her? The ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence?
 <br /><br />The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing.
They do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were unavailable).
O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube ,Busta Rhymes, and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles.
And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor.
Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character ,of the three main characters, changed the most in the film.
<br /><br />John Singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in American college life with this film.
And he did so quite badly.
It was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun.
Life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this.
Higher Learning is proof that he did not understand this at all.
Seeing the film ,then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to.
Not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest."

Yeah, it's got more lapses in logic than I care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself, I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the TV on occasion, but it's funny at least.
Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY funny, there's no need to let that get you down.<br /><br />However, if you've read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then you'd probably best avoid it.
I've read them all and when I first watched this film, I despised it.
I've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site, in fact.

1133_4	"I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one.
A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre.
Usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally resides in making it original, new and inventive.
This movie fails to do so.<br /><br />There is no sense of who the characters really are, apart from Sylvie Moreau's (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais).
They fit into this one-dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie can become annoying, rhythm lacks, and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups.
I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally, or rather, making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious.
Of course, along with that, you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.<br /><br />I can't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive.
If you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy, this is not it.
Or rather, this a poor attempt at it.
You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks.<br /><br />Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is.
But it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's."

Early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since.
The movie lacked intrigue, giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder.
Some of the discourse was, frankly, embarrassing! It's hard to believe anyone would even consider, let alone commit to, the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe."
10237_2	"The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments.
The movie obviously had great reviews.
It's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.<br /><br />I too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on.
One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar.
\In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center, the meaning of the word \""forgive\"" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own\"" But by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more.
After the \""strong-willed\"" Eva Kor forgives her \""Nazi captors\"" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of Kor.
The movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory.
To me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her \""act of forgiveness\"".
Obviously, it was a very sick cow.<br /><br />On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the \""promised land\"" to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago.
From then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.
<br /><br />Firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers.
Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was.
A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan (Professor of education at Bethlehem University) gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.<br /><br />Finally, the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where she is \""grilled\"" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so,
 in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.
<br /><br />I will cut to the chase.
By the end of the movie, I was hoping I hadn't chosen to watch the movie.
The movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears.
It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion.
Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.
<br /><br />Lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? Quoting another IMDb user, \""I don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go.
\"" That would be the perfect layman's definition of MAKING PEACE.
<br /><br />I guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have \""gone through more than the human mind can fathom\"".
<br /><br />P.S.
The dictionary certainly should go into all those Books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making."""
348_2	"This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle.
The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw, Fishburne, and the usually solid Ed Harris.
Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic.
The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along.
It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels.
The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast.
George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty.
The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery/thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree.
The scripting and direction are extremely poor.
Connery's charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue.
Manipulative, Violent, and Ridiculous.
2/10 Avoid It."
4866_1	I have a feeling that Dr.
Dolittle was intended for an audience composed entirely of children.
I think I would have had a better time if I sat at home and watched a sit-com.
My favorite characters in the movie were the pet hamster and the two alley mice.
11770_3	"'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame.
Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline: \Thai lesbians fighting monsters.\"" Rather, this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd (but specific) rules: \""don't walk under a clothesline,
\"" \""don't eat raw meat,\"" and \""don't accept money for your powers.\"" Well, guess what folks, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar-girl' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreign johns' who pay for her services.
<br /><br />While this film can't even be released in Thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between \""Showgirls\"" and \""Interview with the Vampire\"" as directed by Walt Disney.
<br /><br />If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre-teens only.
There is literally broadcast TV adult fare, although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life.
<br /><br />As for the 'lesbian' angle, there's one brief smooch and a couple of \""I love you's\"" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple (on brother).
And the P-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts (there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ...
ooh, phallic imagery).<br /><br />NO nudity, NO real monster (unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD.
You've been warned!"""
7062_1	"OK, not possibly, honestly the worst movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />this made absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no acting, just nothing.<br /><br />here's what i thought when i first saw it may 28th, 2003 **caution, this is a spoiler alert.
it's also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is::<br /><br />ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced, but there is no character explanation.
as far as i knew the main character was new to this school, but apparently not.
also it appeared that he lived by himself...
then that he was a foster kid...
then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still.
also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves.<br /><br />now we come to a main plot point, this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant.
now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus' intently on him for the contingency of the movie.
i think i must have missed a main plot element here, there was no REASON for the main character to get hooked.
even if that's the point, having no reason, why do all his friends, who are skeptical like 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what he wants.<br /><br />so the movie continues on, and it gets all right.
they're running havoc on the school, blah blah blah.
but wait a minute...
suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the 'show' here.
wait a second, didn't the insane guy specifically tell the main character NOT to do that? it was supposed to be anynomous.<br /><br />ah another important plot element has been skipped over...
the insane guy was supposed to not be insane...
everyone said he wasn't insane.
but as the story goes on, he is VERY CLEARLY OUT OF HIS MIND.
but i thought the news people said he wasn't...
hm...<br /><br />now the movie comes to a close.
THAT WAS THE CLOSE? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character, it didn't answer any questions about the insane guy.
are these people in the same situation? if yes, then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this.
if no then what is the point in saying \that's you in two weeks.\""??<br /><br />*end of the thing...*<br /><br />that's what i thought then.
that is pretty much what i still think now.
it's 6 months down the line, and if i can get it for free, i might give it another chance, but i doubt it.
i highly doubt it."""
547_1	"This movie's full title is \Waqt: Race Against Time\"".
That's a race no one can ever win, but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious \""waqt\"" on this bakvaas.
This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest.
It strained my credulity too far.
It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline, and deserves to be mocked for it.<br /><br />It's not quite as awful as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it.
Stupid, pointless, with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji.
The central \""plot\"" is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many \""family\"" BW films.
If my father, who raised me, and who I love dearly, treated me like Big B did Akshay, I'd shoot him myself.
To say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness."""
360_4	"I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end.
However, when I saw the movie I was very disappointed.
First of all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24/25.
The late Christopher Reeve was also miscast-same reason.
Will, according to the book,was around 30.
I would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development.
Also Miss Beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a Plus Size lady.
I know the movie didn't have the budget of the \Bridges Of Madison County\"" which I believe was released around the same time.
<br /><br />But to me this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie.
As someone mentioned, I wish that Miss Spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be.
She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope that she would consider doing the casting too.
The movie let me down!"""
9091_1	"Seriously, I've read some of the reviews on this film, and I have to ask, were you people watching the same movie.<br /><br />Yes, I give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles, but so what? <br /><br />None of the characters are likable, the story seems aimless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress.
Donald Sutherland is just icky.
(and his character \Homer Simpson\"" makes me wish for the animated version.
D'oh!) Then you had the creepy child actor, the creepier Billy Barty, and so on.
<br /><br />This is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go, \""What the heck!\"""""
121_4	"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography.
I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi.
I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages.
In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.
If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film.
The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me."
8905_4	"Everybody knows that Gregory Widen's original \The Prophecy\"" didn't really require a sequel, but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable.
Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery.
The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental.
If it wasn't for Walken's performance (and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig), \""The Prophecy II\"" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release.
The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth.
The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals) from getting born.
For you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly \""monkey\"" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel's evil dominion.
Thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown.
\""The Prophecy II\"" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity.
Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you.
His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences.
On a slightly off-topic note, I often felt like \""The Prophecy II\"" ambitions to look similar to \""Terminator II\""  Gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where \""Terminator II\"" ended as well.
Coincidence, I guess? Overall, this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of Christopher Walken's unique acting charisma (and who isn't?)."""
3376_3	"For anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical A CHORUS LINE, the movie is a shoddy substitute.
Not only are songs cut, but unnecessary plot twists added, new dance sequences choreographed, and, let's face it, Richard Attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers.<br /><br />Onstage, Michael Bennett's A CHORUS LINE was just that: Michael Bennett.
His idea, his choreography, his direction, his gift to Broadway and the rest of the world.
It was two hours of hard-hitting, in-your-face realism that really made you feel for these \boys\"" and \""girls.\"" The movie, however, lacks empathy and depth: the actors look like they are auditioning for A CHORUS LINE rather than actually auditioning.
Every move, every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned; Michael Douglas, especially, as Zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer.
Even when he throws his temper tantrums, you never quite believe him because every gesture, every accented word, every nuance is so obviously rehearsed.
And as for him not dancing: Kevin Kline auditioned for the role of Zach on Broadway.
Michael Bennett loved his reading, but Kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part.
How I wish they had done the same for Douglas! A CHORUS LINE is supposed to be a show about nobodies, and aside from a few recognizable faces (Vicki Frederick, who played Cassie on Broadway, as Sheila and Khandi Alexander, of TV's NewsRadio, as one of the many auditioning dancers) you're not supposed to KNOW any of these people.
Because you DO know these people.
Having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision: when you focus on Michael Douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories, you lose something.<br /><br />It is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show (Montage: Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love) is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled \""Surprise, Surprise\"" that surprisingly received a nomination at the Oscars.
Cassie's \""mirror dance\"" has a new song and tragically boring choreography -- one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.<br /><br />For fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved.
For those who never got to see the original production, either on Broadway or on tour, this movie is the only reference they will have to go by.
And they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest-running musical in Broadway history -- until a little show called CATS overtook it in the late 1990's.
But THAT is a different story, and don't even get me started there."""
6342_3	"I picked this up at the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation (\If you don't like (this), go f&^% yourself!\"") on the box...
seemed like a ringing endorsement....
I was expecting something a bit more like \""Death Proof\""...
not much actual violence in this one tho, or plot, of character, or dialogue.
<br /><br />Look at the poster.
It's all there.
Stunts, and rock.
It goes back and forth.
A week or so in the life of an LA band that does a crappy magic show, at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the Strip, and an Aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet...
They work, they meet girls, they party.
End of story.<br /><br />The band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second-tier, and playing a style that was already dated in 1978.
It has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that Aussie fellow really is something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the \""art\"".
I hung it there to see what crazy thing he'd do next.
Just wish he could have found a better vehicle."""
7478_2	"When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny.
Well I was wrong.
Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible.
The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny.
But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.<br /><br />Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself."
5052_1	"Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing.
Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable.
While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war.
In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon.
For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace.
Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie."
8214_4	"This doesn't quite plumb the depths of Creepshow 3, but it comes close.
It also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracting to say the least.
<br /><br />It also rather irritating rips off The Twilight Zone (with the bookshop being comparable to Serling's later Night Gallery).
Unfortunately, the producers & writers forgot that Serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over.
None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.
<br /><br />Framing story: Adam West is...
well, himself.
He doesn't go the Bruce Wayne/Batman campy 60s route, but he rarely does.
He simply plays the not-particularly-enigmatic \Jay\"" (there's an ominous spine-chilling name to compare to the likes of Dr.
Terror, Eramus, and The Cryptkeeper), and makes some mildly awkward/creepy statements.
<br /><br />Abernathy: Seen Rod Serling's \""A Stop in Willoughby\""? Then you've seen this.
The red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp.
As well directed as can be expected, but basically incoherent.<br /><br />Nex's Diner: Reminiscent of various Serling time travel stories, mixed with Steve Allen's \""A Meeting of Minds.\"" Most of the actors aren't too bad (except for Josh Astin as Cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is mildly interesting.
But like Abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere.
The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out a bit (who wouldn't?), and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.
<br /><br />Life Replay: Not a bad little piece, and manages to predate both Click and Creepshow 3.
I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls.
The main character is mildly sympathetic.
Nothing substantially innovative here, but it's okay.
<br /><br />Fighting Spirit: You see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character, it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption.<br /><br />Finale: So...
why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits? Don't know.
And doesn't make sense.
So...
all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), and the guy in the first segment died.
So how did he get trapped? Did he visit the bookstore before he died, got trapped and...
didn't die? What? Huh? I supposer this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural.
But still...<br /><br />Overall: basically not dissimilar from the two newer Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters.
The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time.
But there's nothing really spectacular here."""
