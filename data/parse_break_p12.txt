11683_8	"I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired.
From a pure writing perspective, 'The 16mm shrine' is an absolute treat, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical of Sterling.
In particular I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, tackling themes of existence and reality, whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride, and desire.
'The sixteen-millimeter shrine' is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever-changing world.
It is also a fantastic example of cerebral Twilight Zone; one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it.
These elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes.<br /><br />The episode is not without its faults however, which mainly lay in Lupino and Leisen shoes.
Ironically, I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable.
This of course being an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written her character.
Furthermore Leisen didn't seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing -which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from Lupino half the time-.
Thankfully Balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots, helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least.<br /><br />As I said previously however, if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, this shouldn't be as bad as it's sometimes made out to be.
In addition to the writing that I mentioned above, the episode also features some fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later!) and decent enough set-design.
Overall 'The sixteen-millimeter shrine\ is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think."""
630_10	"I was not expecting much from this movie.
I was given a ticket for an advanced screening.
I had just gotten off of work.
It was hot and I was tired.
I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.<br /><br />Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect.
Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing.
I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic.
The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical."
7569_10	"At a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen, \Apart From That\"" is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest, fresh and innovative in there presentation than I have ever seen before.
The usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film, leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen.
While watching the movie, and even upon post contemplation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that, performances.
Every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives.
Even so, \""Apart From That\"" does not feel like a documentary or reality television, but instead transcends into a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction.
I look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker.<br /><br />This movie must be seen."""
1284_7	"I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD.
I think it is a very good film.<br /><br />This movie packs a lot of story into a very short time.
You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail, and murder, all in one spot! <br /><br />The lead actors do a credible job.
And, I found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting.<br /><br />However, the supporting cast, primarily the bikers, delivers a stilted performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words.
Perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors.
A couple of the characters, in particular, were exceptionally believable.<br /><br />The musical score is absolutely spot-on, for the times, the tempo, and for moving the story forward.
I found the music a real treat.
I noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of \The Food,\"" I googled them; but, couldn't find anything...<br /><br />In any case, George E.
Carey who wrote, produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much (of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation; and, a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in \""Weekend with the Babysitter.\"""""
7050_7	"I don't want to spend to long here rambling about the plot- you've seen the trailer, and if you haven't its online.
I don't recommend seeing it though- it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film.
So those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance.
It's really funny.
I was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film.
The first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics- my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad Austin Powers film in the final 20.
This however, is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film (which is normally the case).
Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout.
I personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out- only to catch all the details which I was laughing over during the first viewing!"
4603_10	"There is one detail, which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies, but which is present here.
It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too.
Jackie is menacing and psychotic here.
He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back (in a usual laid-back pattern), but he is the one who can go and start the tumult.
His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing.
Every time it goes \crack!\"".
I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend.
It's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen.
Besides, the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall (it also looks like a poster of \""rabochiy\"" from our Soviet era) and some lines in Russian on the left (I noticed that quite accidentally).
That looks terrific (and nostalgic for Russian people).
I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies.
Here there's a lot of this stuff.
It's quite amazing watching the characters falling/jumping/running/driving through all manner of panes.
<br /><br />All three movies are great.
I had been preparing myself to see the down-slide of the quality but I saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts (and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies - that's also excellent and keeps continuity up).
<br /><br />I would like to describe each movie just in a few words: No.1 - great (in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - raging (Jackie is really *beep* off here) and painful (Jackie gets tortured); No.
3 - unbelievable (the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible) and bombastic (should I mention a lot of guns and explosions?).
<br /><br />As to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others.
<br /><br />It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again (at least by me).
Its place is in top 10 among action/comedy jewels.
Finally it's been released in Russia on DVD (the 2nd film has the best options - the Chinese/Russian soundtracks and English/Russian subtitles).<br /><br />Solid 10 out of 10.
Thank you for attention."""
11433_8	"Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in \Lumage\"" (a combination of animation through live action cut-outs) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by Ralph Bakshi in his heyday.
Brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog Ralph (one of a duo of bumbling, rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the hilariously foul-mouthed villain) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: Frivoli vs.
Murkwood or, the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares.
In this context, the MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do.
It's a real pity, therefore, that I have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot (culled from a TV screening) of the uncensored version  there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its VHS release  since the film is otherwise unavailable on DVD.
Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities."""
10213_8	"This whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular \Amelie\"", both having the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role.
Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memory.<br /><br />The film deals with chance, as its English title indicates.
The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects.
From the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the film's context seems to work well.<br /><br />A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.
Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper.
Irene, it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day.
After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as Irene.
It seems they are destined to one another from the start, but alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene.
Faudel, who plays Younes, doesn't have a lot to do until the end, but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part.
The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings.<br /><br />We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected."""

I will avoid naming the murderer but I think it's necessarily obvious because of the plot \""thriller\"" demands.<br /><br />A very well-done but dated film noire (for example: everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters.

8483_7	"It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary.
At times there is almost a desperation, as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound, surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside (as did happen to some), Rin-Tin-Tin.
however, was pertfectly natural.
In such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences, some were sure to stand out John Barrymore's soliloquy from Richard II is a moment certainly worth preserving.
By and large, only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence.
However, this is over all reasonably entertaining, and a must for \film buffs\"" especially interested in the silent to sound transition"""

<br /><br />The cinematography is a beautiful, and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone I believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish.
I see a bright future for this writer/producer/director who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with integrity.<br /><br />Kudos for this achievement."
11136_10	"\Midnight Cowboy\"" is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America.
Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial.
No wonder it was a huge success when initially released.
But be warned, its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made.
The characters are memorable, well-developed, and ultimately tragic.
The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending, something which was basically mandatory by the 80s.
Still, this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film.
Its a time when well-made, innovative, and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer.
All this was over by the time \""Star Wars\"" was released.<br /><br />The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work.
It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing.
Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, \""Midnight Cowboy\"" has aged quite well.
Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released.
The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece.
The characters' backgrounds are never fully explained, but the performances make them completely developed.
Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions).
Plus, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street.
\""Midnight Cowboy\"" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made.

12158_7	"Well, here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film-making! The rudimentary premise of \What's the matter with Helen?\"" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! In the hands of any other movie crew,
 this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director Curtis Harrington (\""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\"") and scriptwriter Henry Farrell (\""HushHushSweet Charlotte\"") in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres.
The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique.
We're literally catapulted back to the 1930's, with a sublime depiction of that era's music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes.
Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls.
Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia.
She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies.
The script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced.
There's never a dull moment in \""What's the matter with Helen\"", although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot.
But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters.
She's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers, Jason Voorhees' and Michael Myers' combined! 
There are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies' house.
There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us, but particularly the set pieces and costume designs (even nominated for an Oscar!) are breathtaking."""
9348_7	"What we've got here is a Situation.
A man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways.
At the end they are forced to let it go.
You can't fix people.
And though in various aspects Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood, that message isn't.
<br /><br />This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who's gone into a nearly psychotic state of PTSS since.
It's about what meeting Charlie does to Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate in dental school and, knowing about his tragedy, spots him on the street and reconnects.
Charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating Manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair.
The hair is Sandler's chief prop to show he's deranged.
And the use of music as an escape must hit home to every iPod-wielding subway rider.<br /><br />Charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically Alan, stuck with a controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him.
Charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund (insurance money from the tragedy), and starts dragging Alan off to \hang out,\"" \""eat Chinese,\"" buy records, or watch a Mel Brooks marathon at a rep house.
Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady, redoing the kitchen over and over, collecting old vinyl of Springsteen, the Who, etc., and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room.<br /><br />Charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him, but also somehow resentful, as we learn later.
Alan has a new patient who is propositioning him.
Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan's.
Trying to help Charlie partly permits Alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them.<br /><br />Cheadle and Sandler make an odd couple, but that doesn't matter, because it's convincing that they might both need each other.
Charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family, because to escape his loss, he is pretending he never had one.
And so what if as a roommate Charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste (no Motown)? Alan wants an escape from his tidy, emasculating life.
He's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners, who lord it over him though it's he who set up the practice.
They're white, by the way, and he's black.<br /><br />There's also the lascivious patient from hell, who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices, but starts looking different when Charlie comes by and notices she's a babe.
His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute.
He's also drawn to the breasts of Liv Tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat Charlie when he admits he might need help.<br /><br />Sandler's mad scenes are a little too theatrical, as are a lot of the plot devices (in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point), but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching.<br /><br />Charlie's not just delusional and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all these efforts to help him start to backfire.
The movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can't be made right.
This is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering.
But there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times, many of the people are too broadly drawn, and the overly grand Hollywood interiors have dreadful décor; only the Manhattan streets look real.
There's a courtroom scene that is preposterous, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who's too good to be true.
Alan's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call.
And yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in P.T.
Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, though that's clearly a better movie, in fact a much better one."""

This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s.
I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.<br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much.
The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing.
Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place.
What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself).
Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should).
As for the Ramones...I was never a fan.
I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me.
If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun.
I especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this.
Otherwise stay away.
I give it a 7."
8114_8	"If scientists behaved in a way that H.G.
Wells was confident they would in the future, history wouldn't quite have turned out the way it did in Things To Come.
Were almost 80 years past the point that Wells wrote The Shape Of Things To Come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before, in some ways farther away.<br /><br />Though such well known players as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson, and Cedric Hardwicke are in the cast, they're more caricatures than real characters.
It's the main weakness with the film, it's devoted to Wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools.<br /><br />Massey's characters, two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view.
Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward.
And Ralph Richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another Thirty Years War fought with modern weapons.
By the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented, poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind.<br /><br />According to Wells, science and conquest can never mix.
Scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things.
In Wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of Hitler and Mussolini.
Those same folks however in order to defeat them, subordinated themselves to the Allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age.
If they behaved as Wells would have liked them to, someone like Albert Einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after World War II.
<br /><br />Wells got it wrong both in time and in development.
He apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power.
Computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment.
Still Things To Come, aided by the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of H.G.
Wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didn't quite get right the shape of Things To Come."
11431_10	"My 3rd-year French classes always enjoyed this film very much.
In a multi-cultural, inner-city high school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in French in class, but I know a lot of discussion went on in English after class).
The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to the one between Protée and France.<br /><br />I always mentioned that I felt this film had one of the \sexiest\"" scenes I had ever seen in a movie.
One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted, \""Yes!\"" when he figured out the scene: the one where Protée is helping Aimée lace up her evening dress, all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror.
Directors use the \""mirror technique\"" when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is \""sexy\"".<br /><br />Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film.
One suggested that one theme of the movie was \""Africanism\"", and that no matter how much one loved Africa or Africans, one cannot \""become\"" African (like the driver tried to do): one must BE African."""

You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it.<br /><br />What I also love is that not everything is a punchline.
For those expecting a formulated joke like Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you won't find it here.
Instead Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic.

4949_8	"10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those 'under the radar' pictures that is drenched in the simplicity that most independent movies have: honest, ad hoc performances by its two leads -- Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who establish quite a complementary if unlikely duo.
The great thing is, this entire movie looks improbable despite its 'road movie' roots.
How Morgan Freeman's unnamed character psychically (not physically)arrives to where he meets this jaded check-out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter -- two people on opposite sides of the coin of society -- is deceptively simple.
So, in a nutshell, while there aren't any bang! moments of Earth-shattering revelations, this movie is a quirky little mood piece that probably otherwise got lost in the shuffle of indies which came out in 2006 but deserves to be seen, if only for its honesty."

5496_9	"Someone has already mentioned \being at the right time at the right place\"" It was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not.
It is all real.
The story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries.
It sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe,led by the US) uses agents who attack \""any\"" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups.
A marine officer in the film mentions this also.
That they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets.
All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey(USA's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.<br /><br />What makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened.
It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez.
Whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, I would not know.<br /><br />And whether Chavez will be defending the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of US and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.<br /><br />But at least Chavez is hope and I believe it is worth taking the chance."""
11401_9	"An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical.
Made at the height of MGM's powers as a musical powerhouse, the film features memorable music from the Gershwins, who rightly have been called the 20th Century's equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart.
<br /><br />Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin' in the Rain (1952).
The two films are actually closely linked.
Aside from the Arthur Freed connection, the Broadway Melody segment in \Rain\"" owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film.
This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film.
And it deserved to be, as it showcases Gene Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.<br /><br />The film's cast is uniformly excellent.
Leslie Caron, incredibly making her film debut, shows a maturity that makes you think she'd been making films for years.
Her introductory dance sequence, and later her work on the Ballet, provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse's work in Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon.
Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly's stoic pal, who gets two of the film's best moments: during the end party sequence (which I will not give away for anyone who hasn't seen the film), and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects.<br /><br />Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly's romantic rival, though he does get a few musical highlights, and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron's romantic rival.
The May-December relationship between Kelly's character and Nina's reminded me of the same \""kept man\"" relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany's.<br /><br />There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin' in the Rain.
The Ballet, though lavish and well-produced, doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie.
Without giving away the plot, the Ballet just happens, with no real rhyme or reason.
And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it really doesn't have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals, the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre.
<br /><br />Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet.
Although the ending shouldn't be a surprise (this IS an MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for a bit more ...
movie after the Ballet ended.
It's as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn't follow the Ballet with anything else.
The film literally left me in the lurch.<br /><br />That negative aside, An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood's musicals.
It doesn't quite reach the heights of Singin' in the Rain, but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time."""
5749_10	"I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality to this comment.
Also, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you have seen the movie.<br /><br />Although it is tragically sad to say, that movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so striking that it is truly scary.
The rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how persons who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives.<br /><br />This could not have been a work of fiction; it had to be based on personal experience.
<br /><br />My testament to the how good the movie was is shown by the fact that, although it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a searingly painful experience that I will never be able to see it again.
<br /><br />But I endorse it heartily to all others as a chance to peer into the soul of another human being to the extent that you probably never experienced before or will ever again.
I know that for a fact, because that's my soul you will be observing."

You find yourself relaxing, and seeing others in a more benevolent light...

8618_8	"Pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history.
What do you do? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change the Japanese G.I.s in G.I.
Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on Pearl Harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie.
But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs.
samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other.
And yes, there are decapitations.<br /><br />Of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers.
Even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the Hell of it.
Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.<br /><br />Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version."
6633_10	"The first film ever made.
Workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right or left.
Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unadorned, observation.
The truth.
There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.<br /><br />But consider this short again.
There is nothing 'objective' about it.
The film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right or left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is).
And yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will.
The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.<br /><br />worse is the historical reality of the film.
These factory workers are Lumiere employees.
The bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions.
The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment.
Behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace.
The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them.
The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants.
A frightening, all too prophetic movie."
11776_9	"Chuck Jones's 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast paced, often hilarious cartoon.
Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setting.
The chase takes Bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store.
This great gag is trumped, however, by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time.
It's a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag.
By that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has made its mark as one of the great chase films, bursting with wild energy.
As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character."
2650_10	"Besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1)Stanley Kubrick 2)God Allmighty 3)the rest...
this movie actually is better than the book (and the TV miniseries though this is an easy feat, considering the director).
The flawless filming stile, the acting and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror.
I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got a hold of it.
IT BLEW ME AWAY!!! It is far better than I ever imagined it.
It starts slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense.
The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film.
Also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent day horror films.
Just watch it!"
10042_10	"James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event...
It's an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope, love and humanity...
<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma...
Conveying passion, trust, insouciance and ingenuity, he's a free-spirited wanderer with artistic pretensions, and a zest for life...
<br /><br />Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused upper-class teen engaged to a nasty rich guy who finds herself, one night, plunged to the depths of despair...<br /><br />Billy Zane is an arrogant racist, abusive and ultra rich who would lie, cheat, steal, bribe with money or even use an innocent young child to escape defeat...
He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI...<br /><br />Kathy Bates is the legendary unsinkable Molly Brown, the richest woman in Denver, who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship...<br /><br />Frances Fisheris is the impecunious cold snobbish mother who, deathly afraid of losing her social stature, forces her daughter to become engaged to marry a rich, supercilious snob...
<br /><br />Victor Garber is the master shipbuilder, the real-life character who attempts to fix time, to measure it, in a sense, to make it into history...
<br /><br />Jonathan Hyde is the White Star Chairman who wants the Titanic to break the Trans-Atlantic speed record, in spite of warnings that icebergs may have floated into the hazardous northern crossing...<br /><br />Bill Paxton is the opportunistic undersea explorer in search for a very rare diamond called the \Heart of the Ocean.
\"" <br /><br />Gloria Stuart is the 101-year old woman who reveals a never-before told love story...
The nightmare, the horror and the shock are imprinted upon her deeply lined face...
<br /><br />'Titanic' is loaded with luminous photography and sweeping visuals as the footage of the shipwrecked Ocean liner lying motionless on the ocean floor; the incredible transformation of the bow of the sunken 'Titanic' that takes the viewer back to 1912, revealing the meticulously re-created interiors;
 the first sight of the Titanic steamed steadily toward her date with destiny; the Titanic, leaving the Southampton dock, and some dolphins appear jumping, racing along in front of the luxurious ship; DeCaprio and Winslet flying at the ship's front rail in a gorgeous magic moment; 
the intertwining of past and present as Jack was drawing Rose on his paper, the camera zooms closely on young Rose's eye, only to transform its shape into Gloria Stuart's aged eye...
<br /><br />Chilling scenes: Titanic's inevitable collision with destiny; James Cameronin one of the most terrifying sequences ever put on film takes us down with the Titanic, finally leaving us floundering in the icy water, 
screaming for help that never comes...
<br /><br />Winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, James Cameron's \""Titanic\"" is a gigantic epic where you don't just watch the film, you experience it! The visual effects are amazing, like no other film's...
The decor is overwhelming...
James Horner's music intensifies the emotions...
The whole movie is hunting and involving, filled with a wide range of deep feelings...
<br /><br />It's truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship..."""
6053_10	"A comedy gem.
Lots of laugh out loud moments, the shop and pub scenes had me belly- laughing uncontrollably.
The characters are recognisable and the dialogue well-observed - I know people like this! The humour is surprisingly gentle and the film (this may sound strange) puts me in mind of an Ealing Comedy.
It's a quirky little film with lots of detail.
It certainly takes a number of viewings.
I've watched it a few times (I've been showing all my friends!) and notice something new each time - a bit of dialogue,something visual that I hadn't picked up on before.
I could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but I'm not going to because overall this is a great fun, feel-good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy.
It is a film which will find it's friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there.
Oh....
and It has a great soundtrack."
10325_10	"I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly entertaining.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think I'm odd but there you are.
\I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls\"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men.
This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers.
Ron Ely is a God.It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK.
I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron.(like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine).
I give it 10/10."""
1330_9	"How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-affirming.
It ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen, even though you were hoping--maybe even beleiving--it wouldn't.<br /><br />Utlimately, this is the film's greatest strength: it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations, then drops a bomb on you.<br /><br />I saw this in a film theory class at USC back in the mid-'90s.
It is not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting for."
4331_7	"Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the better Poirot books, as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending.
There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking, with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score.
As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comedic highlight of the episode being Poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings.
The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances, but are careful not to overshadow the two leads, a danger in some Christie adaptations.
Some of the episode was quite creepy, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one.
What made it creepy in particular, putting aside the music was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window.
About the adaptation, it was fairly faithful to the book, but I will say that there were three things I didn't like.
The main problem was the pacing, it is rather slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens.
I didn't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer.
In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer, and under-developing that, made him a less appealing character, though I am glad they didn't miss his drug addiction.
(I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer's next victim.) The other thing that wasn't so impressive was that I felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of Amy Leatheran, like it was in the book, Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation.
On the whole, despite some misjudgements on the writers' behalf, I liked Murder in Mesopotamia.
7/10 Bethany Cox."
284_10	"the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today.
yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other.
their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show.
the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives.
the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son).
each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it.
i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great.
he was by far my favorite character.
it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made.
it was a great show I'm gonna miss it."
478_7	"I'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final.
Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move.
In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1.
Thus he is unable to play the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience."
6299_8	"There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former.
This short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience.
It presents a simple story, told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going, then just gets better and better.
Clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman can easily make it on their own.
Likeable and funny, hilariously so towards the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre."

He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch films.
Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors.
I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls.
My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree.
I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct.
Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man.
I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died.
Dutch films are different but still enjoyable."
9504_10	"As many people know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of the Mexican Cinema, fortunately, during the late 90's, and early 21st century, great movies like La Ley de Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También and, of course, El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba, appeared.
El Coronel..., is a wonderful movie, that retells the classic story by Gabriel García Márquez, by eliminating the magic realism elements, and replacing them with the crude reality lived in Mexico, not only by people like the Colonel, who wait for their pensions, but by more than the half of the Mexican population, who live in complete poverty.
The film's characters, satirically represent classic characters found in Mexican society, such as the nationalist Colonel, the cold and even ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time loyal compadre, the tolerant and patient wife, the hidden homosexual, etc.
This movie, is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican society, and specially, if you want to watch a gorgeous movie, by one of Mexico's finest directors"
10188_8	"The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script.
The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja.
All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to India.
When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhar's family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless.
Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies.
When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India.
Here starts the intense struggle which can be called \Nandini vs.
Narasimha\"".<br /><br />India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct.
The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent.
Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world.
The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing.
One thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful.
The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film.
Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch.
Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.<br /><br />The film's biggest strength is the performances.
Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini.
Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible.
She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son.
Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child.
After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance.
One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha.
He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him.
Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction.
He is outstanding.
Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India's most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection.
Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief.
Anyway, do watch Shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch."""
12292_10	"I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné...
almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is one detail I'd like to shed some light onto: no footage of the real, still standing, Hôtel du Nord (is it still? I heard it was to be demolished...) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks."
7774_7	"\Written on the Wind\"" was an enormously successful Universal picture.
It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given.
Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality.
Mr.
Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly, \""Dallas\"" and \""Dynasty\"", just to mention two.<br /><br />The fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio.
Most of the decor is phony.
Like a lot of those 1950s pictures, \""Written on the Wind\"" was shot entirely in a studio lot.
Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan, or Miami, or even the lake are, one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop.
Mr.
Sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way.<br /><br />We recently caught a screening, part of a revival of Mr.
Sirk's work, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne, appears.
There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later on his own daughter, the evil Marylee, caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk, a sort of phallic object d'art.<br /><br />Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to give over the top performances, 
which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a certain degree, Robert Stack, who overacts as Kyle, the tormented heir of the story.
That would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen.
The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who wasn't asked to make her Lucy Moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd.
<br /><br />Together with his other Hollywood movies, \""Written on the Wind\"" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see: stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen"""
255_10	"There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's 'Ned Kelly' film did.
Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself.
Since then, I have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film.
It is also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films.
This film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point.
The cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might I add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters.
It is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines.
However, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded.
In reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history.
For example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film.
Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt's efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery.
Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention.
I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation.
However, I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation.
It certainly inspired me to look more closely.
So, watch it and decide for yourself.
You might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine.
Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience? For me, I'd call it a breath of fresh air!"
4179_10	"This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid.
Since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies.
As such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.
The Japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior's death.
Of course, under the code of Bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded.
A fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared."

I understood it in terms of the plot, and it didn't really upset my sensibilities (not much), but it was the first time I ever saw it, at least, in a \""mainstream\"" movie.
I thought it was a gutsy move for its time, and took courage for them to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the midst of his time as PG-rated Superman.

8979_10	"I loved this film, at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got into it.
There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in cutting it down.
If you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here, (and some real tossers).
Technically I liked it a lot too, they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I wasn't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers.
(Open Water drove me nuts, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema).
Sorry that's my own little rant.
I definitely recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious, I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a classic piece."
12088_9	"Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show.
<br /><br />Yes, it is predictable much like The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc etc etc.<br /><br />This show is just good clean television.
The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing.
They often take jabs at each other several times an episode, which adds a great deal of humor to the show.
It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but, who doesn't enjoy a good car chase? Especially with the Coyote! <br /><br />I only wish they made clean television like this today I highly recommend this!"
6027_9	"I was told it was one of those \either you love it or you hate it\"" movies.
Well, I loved it.
Obvious hippie-era, dated and easy symbolism and all.
So, I probably have no taste at all when it comes to Antonioni, but this and La Notte (made exactly a decade earlier) are my favourites among his movies so far.
Made two years before I was born, Zabriskie Point was supposed to have been Michelangelo's great American epic.
But apparently, it turned out to be a flop.
I really can't see why.
Before watching it I'd read that it was rather boring, so I braced myself for a very slow movie - though I love me a slow movie.
For my taste, Zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it.
While watching it, I made a mental note of how European it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene, enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight.
This recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in American society.
But then I watched L'Eclisse straight afterwards, which is set in Rome in the early 60s, and noticed that Antonioni often included billboards in it as well.
After all, the masterful use of landscapes, architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an Antonioni trademark  this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters' psychological states, with more or less understated power and great visual impact.
He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill.<br /><br />Zabriskie Point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s, but never did.
Mark Frechette, whom I'd already seen in Francesco Rosi's fine WWI-set movie Uomini Contro, had a very tragic life and died aged just 27.
According to his biography page, he donated his $60,000 earnings from Zabriskie to a commune.
Mark's co-star Daria Halprin, apparently also Dennis Hopper's wife later on, has the stunning, natural beauty and appeal of a young Ornella Muti  one of those luminous beauties that don't need a shred of make-up to turn heads.
Like Frechette, she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star, but at least she didn't die tragically.
Most notably, Zabriskie Point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed - one that brings home a sense of youthful playfulness like few I've seen - as well as a powerfully cathartic ending.
It may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes, but I can't see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release.
Never has an explosion looked so good, and so poetic.
It seems to be an explosion that restores order rather than bringing chaos."""
3501_9	"One of the best films I have seen in the past five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with the two leads being superstars in the making.
Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts Larry Clark's often-nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs...
although I have to admit that Bully was a cut above his normal fare.
Raising Victor Vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing...
so don't miss it!"
7055_8	"Although Cinderella isn't the obvious choice for a sequel I love Jaq and Gus so I didn't hesitate.
The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was an inspired one.
I enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this.
The three stories are cute & amusing, although the songs were forgettable.
Jaq and Gus were my favourite characters but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, the Mice Chorus and all the rest.
Pom Pom proved the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the Governess.
A sequel done right for a change.
My rating 8/10."
7788_10	"I love Ashley Judd and think all of her movies are great.
Ruby<br /><br />in Paradise is one of her best.
It is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it.
A story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy.
Some of her movies such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals.
They were very good movies<br /><br />also, but take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you will agree it is one of Ashley's Best.<br /><br />"
5231_10	"to communicate in film essential things of life - like what is life, does it have a meaning? - is sheer impossible.
Of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness.
This happens if the input from the senses overrules the \input\"" from our mind, i.e.
our thoughts.
Few directors know how to communicate essential things.
Tarkovsky, is one.
His \""Stalker\"" shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind.
I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same."""
1464_7	"More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho does sound better as a header.
The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you will) does depict movies here in his own way.
Most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here at IMDb and I'd strongly advise you to see them (especially the Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Conversation & and the Lynch movies), because Slavoj Zizek will reference them! <br /><br />Or in other words, he might spoil them for you.
I don't remember if he spoiled more than those I've listed (I think the Chaplin movies too), but as I wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand! In the IMDb listing there is a movie missing, that I did report to them, so it might get up there pretty soon.
It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways.<br /><br />Zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you're open minded to see things through another perspective (even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ...
it doesn't mean it will do that, but it could)!"
5682_7	"No, this is not no Alice fairy tale my friends! This `Wonderland' fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that occurred back in 80's California.
At the center of this bloodbath was no other than `Johnny Wad' himself.
Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine.
Besides being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various Hollywood junkies.
Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes, but for once this Holmes character did not milk it through completely.
The film possesses a `who's who' of supporting players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs , Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as the women in Holmes life, and Eric Bogosian as a menacing Tinsletown entrepreneur.
These characters do play integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the `Wonderland' murders.
Out of this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was the most fierce & impressive as the ardent Ron Launius.
Lucas is gradually escalating into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in `A Beautiful Mind' & `Sweet Home Alabama'.
Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes, just like Holmes' famous organ.
Holmes was eventually acquitted of the `Wonderland' murders.
He died of complications from the Aids virus.
`Wonderland' will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night, and if Holmes really laid out his weapon.
Oops! Wrong Holmes movie! Ok! That is enough before I get `penislized' I mean penalized.
Bye Holmies! *** Average"
5378_7	"This is an interesting little flick made in 1967, with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh...OK, it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun.
I saw many similarities between this and 'Creature with the Blue Hand' (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they do have the same director! Scotland Yard's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college.
Seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done.
There's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid, and there's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine, it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire.
Joachim Fuchsberger plays an Inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance.
There's a \monk\"", and how anyone identifies this thing as a \""monk\"" is beyond me, it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood, more of a Klan member of a different color than a monk.
There's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk, and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight, a nifty trick right there.
This is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones, and while it's rather silly at times it is fun to watch.
7 out of 10, not bad...."""
7300_8	"Like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous.
The producer's last outing, \Mosquitoman-3D\"" had the same problem.
It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it.
The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface.
But even that was only passable.
Poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish.
With Dolphins and Whales, the technology is all but wasted.
Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's stunning 3D capabilities.
There are far too few scenes of any depth or variety.
Close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth.
Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got Shark-Week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment."""
9191_10	"Okay, I didn't get the Purgatory thing the first time I watched this episode.
It seemed like something significant was going on that I couldn't put my finger on.
This time those Costa Mesa fires on TV really caught my attention- and it helped that I was just writing an essay on Inferno! But let me see what HASN'T been discussed yet...<br /><br />A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator.
Yeah, 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons, especially religious, but here's one more for ya.
On a hunch I consulted wikipedia, and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels? Purgatorio.
Excluding ante-Purgatory and Paradise.
(The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and...
what Tony can't get to.) <br /><br />On to the allegedly \random\"" monk-slap scene.
As soon as the monks appeared, it fit perfectly in place with Tony trying to get out of Purgatory.
You can tell he got worried when that Christian commercial (death, disease, and sin) came on, and he's getting more and more desperate because Christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him.
By the time he meets the monks he's thinking \""hey maybe these guys can help me?\"" which sounds like contemplating other religions (e.g.
Buddhism) and wondering if some other path could take him to \""salvation\"".
Not that Tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a Buddhist, but it appears Finnerty tried that (and messed up).
That slap in the face basically tells Tony there's no quick fix- as in, no, you can't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here.
<br /><br />Tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven.
But at the \""conference entrance\"", he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him.
At first I saw the name vs.
driver's license problem as Tony having led sort of a double life, what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people.
He feels free to have an affair with quasi-Melfi because \""he's Kevin Finnerty\"".
He figures out that he CAN fool some people with KF's cards, like hotel receptionists, but it won't get him out of Purgatory.
Those helicopters- the helicopters of Heaven?- are keeping track of him and everything he does.<br /><br />After reading all the theories on \""inFinnerty\"", though, it seems like KF's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths Tony could've taken in his life.
Possibly along with the car joke involving Infiniti's that made no sense to me otherwise.
Aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out."""
3595_10	"This movie has made me want to become a director, and Michelle Rodriguez is brilliant.
How the hell wasn't she on mtv's top 25 under 25, she beats them all.
This film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance, best film i have ever seen."
842_9	"The Matador is a witty, dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from Pierce Brosnan, who has never ever been better than here, and the always reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role here since playing Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor in As Good As It Gets.
A big plus goes to the writing as well.
Clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by Brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way.
The story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next.<br /><br />Nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film.
But that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat."
4090_8	"This movie is simply incredible! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw.
However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior.
Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography.
It even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of \sexual art\"".
Every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way.

3788_10	"This movie is gorgeous.
It's real and down to heart, but at the same time totally crazy.
The characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have so many different minds, but each of us could refer to at least on.
In Canada, we don't have many movies from Eastern Europe, and for the few I have seen, Loners is one of the best.
It's very funny, and magic.
If you want to see something new and refreshing, go see Loners."

After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house.
Soon, a pair of escaped convicts show up and, after much delaying of the inevitable, they proceed to rape Janet and lock Richard in a birdcage.<br /><br />This LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made.
It's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers.
Moreover, I found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone.
I love CAGED TERROR.
The music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty.
I found the film to be quite creepy.<br /><br />The flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film, which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering.
While I didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question, I do think that it will both most people.
The acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue, at least in the early scenes.
This film takes a little more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone.<br /><br />In short, this was a good film.
Not the greatest horror film I've ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun.
It's not exactly the easiest film to find.
It's possible to find it in the USED section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough.
It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out."
4364_7	"I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before \Rob Roy\"" came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing.
Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a really good job as his wife Mary.
Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one person very likely to make your skin crawl.<br /><br />All in all, this comes out as good as \""Braveheart\"" (maybe even better).
I laugh when I think of how Hollywood released two movies almost back-to-back taking a swipe at England.
Very good.

4325_10	"This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me.
The representation of the court of Chancery as a 'character' in the drama is magnificent.
The acting is marvellous, from the sinister Tulkinghorn, to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte, and the two young lovers.
But it is the spider's web of chancery that holds the whole thing together, and the cinematography is superb.
What mistake did the BBC make about copyright that meant that this version could not be seen in the UK on either video or DVD for many years? I tried to find out from them, but faced a stone wall.
In the end I got a DVD copy from Canada."

Missed in this movie was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, affecting.
Undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs, taboos of the times and classes, race relations not being in a very good state of equality, guilt, yearning, hate, confusion, very dark emotionally I thought, under the skin, you have to submit to the aire of it, a flowing movie, not slow as stated before, release yourself to the flow of the film, the emotions will show themselves, characters reveal their flaws, their nasty insides, excellent and actually very cruel!"

And yes, the Hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good, but not good enough.
The lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version, although the acting was wonderful.<br /><br />George C.
Scott is simply incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge.
We all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later on that evening.
Scott is properly gruff as Scrooge.
Too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new-found glee that he awakens to on Christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson.
But hey, this is George C.
Scott.
He's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy.
He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner.<br /><br />The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, as are the costumes, music, and scenery.
19th Century London comes to life in Clive Donner's visionary style.
The film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits.
The important tale of morality shines through in every frame, though.<br /><br />You won't often find this version aired on television anymore, and that is a disappointment.
The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday.

The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant.
The dynamics of their relationship are surprising.
Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve gets one of his few chances to really act.<br /><br />I confess that I've never seen Ira Levin's play, but I hear that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is faithful.

The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples.
He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A-List about him.
The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti-hero.
That is not very normal.
Jean Peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold.
That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool-pigeon.<br /><br />The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk.
There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty gritty and exciting.<br /><br />I think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film.
For non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone."
8611_8	"I very much enjoyed watching this film.
I taped it while watching so that i could review it later.
I actually enjoyed the second viewing more since i was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between Natalie and Adam, the 2 main characters.
I thought the way this story evolved was very thought provoking.
I got very intrigued with how Natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends , at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of animosity but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold.
i wasn't disappointed .
Gradually the secrets that Sara kept from her mother started to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, a flawed human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a domineering mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom.
The viewers who stuck with this film to the end saw a very touching performance from Diane Keaton (who is always wonderful, even in some of her less well received films-think Town and Country).
The closing scene of Diane Keaton driving home was well worth waiting for, revealing that anyone who loves another human being has got to learn that we have to live our own lives, we love others but don't own them and ultimately we have to let go.
It's a hard lesson but well worth contemplating now and then.Thank you CBS for this broadcast,it was worth the long wait."

The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together.

477_10	"Hi all I am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6.
I supposed I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film.<br /><br />In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924.
He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz.
Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return.<br /><br />The social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments.
Chess I suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life.
A major example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer.
Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways.<br /><br />In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin.
The format is a knockout, which actually the world Governing body of Fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final.
But this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other.<br /><br />The position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself.
In fact, I have done a youtube video about it, for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon"

The whole Oirish thing gets kinda thick, but you DO enjoy the cast here-Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc.
All good.
I also liked seeing Mike Mazurki-of Course he played a boxer, what else? Typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.<br /><br />Flynn is fine as Gentleman Jim, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all.
The boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's vaudeville logging act a riot, and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times.<br /><br />Really alotta fun, Flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why audiences loved him.<br /><br />*** outta ****"
12428_8	"I enjoyed this movie.
Unlike like some of the pumped up, steroid trash that is passed off as action movies, Playing God is simple and realistic, with characters that are believable, action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end.<br /><br />Well directed, well acted and a good story."
1469_7	"I admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it (and they are not pervs!) as a must see.
And it is a must see! Just don't expect to see something outbreaking.<br /><br />The Freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film, but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end.<br /><br />Some of the good things are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more I missed (I just remembered...Dogville), and I usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air.
<br /><br />Other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of Mr.
Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, specially in north America.
Again, it's way over the top and I believe not to be a completely waste of time for I do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood."
9142_10	"Purple Rain...
what else can i say, the title speaks for itself.
But i think all the actors were well picked.
The movie had a great story.
I loved it! Ever since i watched that movie, i've been stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions, and the Apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand.
Critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance.
Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, he actually acted like himself.
I'm so glad I've seen this movie.
The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so heartfelt.
I cried more than once."
3583_10	"This was a great movie but it had the worst ending I think I have ever seen!!! The actors were great and displayed wonderful talent.
The entire story was twisted and unexpecting, which, is what made it entertaining.
As good as the movie was, the entire film is judged by the ending, which was terrible! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending."
9141_8	"You can debate Prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this film.
There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now.
He seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic.
<br /><br />Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time.
From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor \Little Nikki\"" and every thing else under the sun via the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every \""Air Band\"" at the time impersonating Prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out.
For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson.
<br /><br />We all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered.
It didn't disappoint.
EVERYONE was caught up.
I was an MTV junkie at the time(they actually played music then....all the time)Prince played at least once or twice an hour.
I must qualify this commentary by saying that, at that time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk/ New Wave genre' The music of Prince at the time transcended all types and styles.
One of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big then.
All the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then.
It was mainstream and it seems like a cliché' now.
It got so popular that it became ridiculous.
It's like the rappin' Granny commercial for Wendy's Hamburgers.
<br /><br />It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was caught up in it (sadly, kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something.
Anyway, I hope this gave you all a little insight."""
963_8	"Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about him doing a kids film, because I would hate to see him depart from his films I came to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy.
Lately he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he's succeeding.
Still this was the first of his films I'd seen him take that direction, so I was nervous.
Of coarse I bought it without seeing it and was glad I did.<br /><br />Great Yokai War is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too.
The whole film reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc.
I enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either.
The dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be.
I personally wasn't bothered by the CGI and prosthetics.
I feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice.<br /><br />If you are a die hard Takashi Miike fan, you may not like this one.
But, I suggest giving it a shot.
It proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected he is.
He also continues to make his signature Miike films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.<br /><br />To those people that are new to Takashi Miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one, I suggest these other Miike films: 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of the Katakuris' 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China.'
<br /><br />Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars."

6047_10	"The brilliant thing about Withnail & I is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery.
Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16.
I know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in Cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in Hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it.
I grew up in the forest of Dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days (had some great mates - hate to think what they're all up to now - probably running the local council).
I've watched it a couple of times on DVD and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection (how can i like this film and the Dambusters - doesn't seem right somehow) I certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done.
I like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity.
I have tried to obtain the soundtrack, but it has not been released (shame, as it's a corker).
Someone told me it was originally a stage play, not quite sure how that worked but i'm sure it was fun.
I liked the little Shakespearian touches/references that seem to crop up throughout the film (also spotted the Dylan Thomas ref as well) and like all little gems, there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to Easyrider as they start they're next journey.
All in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making (love it!)"
8712_8	"OK.
I admit.
I'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series.
Star Trek (Next Generation) was my first space date, and since then I've switched partners regularly.
I've seen'em all, it seems, and my favorites are «Lexx», «Farscape» and the new «Battlestar Galactica», in other words: the newest, state of the art space operas.
But, I also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones, the cheap ones, like the magnificent four seasoned BBC show «Blakes7».
Here, the budgets are smaller than hobbits, the special effects seem to be made on a Commodore 64, but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor, the acting dead serious and at times even high class?<br /><br />But why do they always speak English in the space future? Because this is NOT the future, it's fantasy for kids.
Still, it can be irritating at times.
Me, being a Norwegian, have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series, like science fiction, for Scandinavian viewers.
I never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened.
But it did, actually, once, and even in my own homeland, Norway.
I was two years old when the so called Fjernsynsteatret (TV theater section) of our national public service channel Nrk produced this three episode version of Blindpassasjer (The Stowaway).<br /><br />When I first heard of it, I was not surprised of the fact that until this day, the show has only been screened once in Norway, making it impossible for me to actually see it.
It went on Swedish, danish and Finnish television also, in it's time, but that was a long time ago.
There have been no video or DVD release of it, not a surprise either, and when it was screened on an art house cinema, this happened in Bergen, a city far far away from Oslo (where I live).
And then there's another fact about «Blindpassasjer» that didn't surprise me, that it was written by the two Norwegian authors Tor Åge Bringsværd and Jon Bing (Bing&Bringsværd).
This duo basically introduced the SciFi genre to Norwegians in the seventies; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose.
In my opinion, Bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers, and has written several great and entertaining novels, masterpieces even, some of them hilarious, such as «Bazar» and «Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost».
No other than this guy, also an acclaimed dramatist, could construct the script of «Blindpassasjer».<br /><br />When I finally got to watch it, it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR in the 80's, eventually managed to transform it to DVD and give it to me.
He was a nice bloke.
So I sat down and watched it, with Swedish subtitles, bad sound and some scrapes and errors; but the thing came through and I was surprised that I eventually came to love it.<br /><br />The exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in Blakes7, and the credit goes to Caprino studios (who made the famous Flåklypa Grand Prix), and the interior of the Marco Polo (the space ship) works better than I'd expected.
The acting is typically theatrical, but it works better than when they play Ibsen, to put it mildly, and Bjørn Floberg carries his role solidly, as does Trini Lund.
The legendary actress Henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre, but this is an ensemble play, and I'm happy to say that Ola B.
Johannesen carries his mustache with nobility, and Marit Østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.<br /><br />But is it really that good? Well, one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending, the pretentious criticism of «modern society», but yes, it's, well, not really really really fantastic, but charming, cool, nostalgic and pleasant.
One and a half hour of classic Norwegian SciFi."
9930_8	"I'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum, and many of the reviews.
I think Tony Scott made a good movie here.
Yes, it is highly stylized, flashy and over the top, but it is very entertaining.
I'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agrees with me :) <br /><br />This movie may not be for anyone, but if you like over-the-top, dark humor, cool action and dialog, you should see it.
<br /><br />I've previously seen Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies, but I like this one more.
It's like a roller-coaster ride, with great soundtrack selections, visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity, gory violence, and have explicit dialog.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot, and even shows nipples in this one, either..."
6150_7	"I have personally seen many Disney movies in my lifetime, though absolutely none of them match up in any way to Bedknobs and Broomsticks.
Although I personally wouldn't have crossed live-action with animation, it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters.
The movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country.
I would have to say that the casting was brilliant.
Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest.
Endings always surprise me and this was no exception.
It was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if this was intentional.
The dialog wasn't great, but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie, that is alright.
Overall, I would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialog six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten."
1321_10	"Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature.
Forbidden Lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book Forbidden Love, and THAT was a best-seller.
An onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman, Lie$ is the very best in editorialised reality TV.<br /><br />Cleverly edited and colourful, Broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke.
I disagree (with Variety) that it's overlong; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others' just-recorded testimonials.
On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired.....so I watched it twice.<br /><br />This Oscar-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny, upsetting, and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another.
The apparent con unfolded in the Australian State of Queensland via very personal swindles of Khouri's friends and fans(!).
Clearly these friends are now \turned\"", the funniest on-camera line belonging to Khouri's QLD neighbour Rachel Richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat, no-nonsense colloquialisms: \""I think it's a load of sh!t.
Personally\"".<br /><br />We need to learn from their experience, hence my belief in spoilers.
Any perennial lie-spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie.
<br /><br />There's some breathtaking footage of Khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian, who instead presses her (con)\""Artist\"" repeatedly for corroboration.<br /><br />Since being busted by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after publication, Khouri has been on the run, but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name.
She absconded supposedly because a) she's either terrified of her sly, more-Italian-sounding-than-Greek husband, or b) because she needed her passport/visas to clear her name.
<br /><br />Unlikely.<br /><br />A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained her trail in Queensland before she again skipped overseas (one guess: No, not Jordan).
According to a closing card, Khouri is \""still under investigation by the FBI\"" in 2007.<br /><br />I guessed audiences might just give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge.
Instead, the audiences I sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen.
Once they caught on, there was plenty counter-derision and catcalls; earlier, stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn't know how to take Khouri's evolving contradictions.<br /><br />The filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end, not leaving anything out--not even her own self-sacrifice.<br /><br />Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by Khouri herself.
The putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first--key to how a lifelong liar operates: in half-truths.
Khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr-old with rather disarming charm, and surprisingly, worked-out biceps.<br /><br />Gradually we're introduced to less-and-less-adulating Aussie journos, publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of Khouri's honour-killing accusations hook, line and sinker.
Later we see their more rueful reactions, quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact, if some perhaps a little bitter.<br /><br />It was Jordanian (anti-)honour-killing activists who took deepest umbrage at Khouri's fallacies because its pot-stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change.
Honour-killings do happen in Jordan; it's just their prevalence that's at odds with Khouri's book--plus 72 other \""facts\"".
In 2003 these activists faxed (Australian) Random House with 73 painstakingly-checked objections.<br /><br />The publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first-time author Khouri never tried to check any facts.
Leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract, they too were fair game.
So a massive hot-topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in Internet cafes.<br /><br />Later still we're shocked to discover that the \""factual errors\"" extend to Khouri's bio as well.
For one thing, she's not only not a 35yr-old virgin (her defence is that she merely didn't disabuse people of their assumptions), but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she's just too fast-talking in her American accent.
She also seems too-comfortable with cellphone technology and Western clothes.
I realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very Jordanian women who don't need any Western paternalism from me, but when even cultural cues don't jibe in addition to Khouri's \""facts\"", you've got to start questioning your source.<br /><br />At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion.
She makes an admirable effort to hold Khouri to account, in person, in Jordan.
The last third is consumed with a fact-finding trip back to Amman, where one \""fact\"" after another falls.
Eventually Broinowski forces her (con)\""Artist\"" to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story, and it's after this that Khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera.
Secret, because in it Khouri's \""American security guard\"" Jeremy is heard to have an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We never find out how Anna uncovered it.) <br /><br />So this becomes the filmmaker's triumph, as she never flags in her tone or commitment.
Her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt, FBI documents--and Khouri's most shocking initial crime.
<br /><br />Anna Broinowski (watch-list her now) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device (key players cross-commenting on footage) to kill two birds--making her audiences want to drink from the same well again.<br /><br />In fact, despite her deceptively demure approach, she made me re-confirm that Overington and Knox really DID win their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their \""Norma Khouri Investigation\"".
<br /><br />Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.(10/10)"""

7893_7	"I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film.
Is it one of the best of the \Nightmare\"" series? Maybe not, but I had lots of fun with it.
Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential.
Since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, I felt this so-called final installment (\""New Nightmare\"" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump.
There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which Freddy controls.
This is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like Super Mario.
And Freddy belts out the funny one-liner, \""Great graphics.\"" And since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove.
Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove.
<br /><br />The cast is superb.
Lisa Zane is perfectly cast in the lead.
I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since \""The Running Man,\"" and I think the last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago.
He's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence.
And who can forget the cameos? The best one is by Johnny Depp (from the first \""Nightmare\"") playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial.
<br /><br />The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome! So for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on DVD! Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed.
<br /><br />I personally didn't see many things wrong with the film.
It even elaborated on Freddy's backstory.
The film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific.
Could this have given better justice to the franchise? Of course it could have.
But Rachel Talalay did a fine job.
And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.<br /><br />And in closing, I loved the montage over the opening credits.
Fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy.

2030_9	"The Man from Snowy River II doesn't reinvent the wheel but is a crowd-pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes.<br /><br />For those fans wanting the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River film a hit, (breathtaking scenery, sweeping score, sweet romanticism and cracking action) this film really delivers.
This story picks up a few years from the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses.
He returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish well-bred sweetheart Jessica (played by Aussie divine lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feather's cattle station (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy).
The foil to Jim and character that shakes the plot is the well-to-do upper class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his sights on Jessica.
Add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the acting.
Tom Burlinson fits snugly into Jim's wide brim hat and laconic humour.
Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen.
Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas was never going to be easy and Brian Dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part.<br /><br />The music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a Victoria tourism reel.
There are moment however that feel very self-indulgent, like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama.
A little more grit would have sufficed here, we are Aussie's, we can take it!! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief.
However the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clichés, there are some really inventive and touching scenes.
Jim putting the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before its time) Jim and Jessica setting up home, the fabulous scene where Jim shows up Alistair's riding with his trusty whip.
I can see why this character is such an icon.<br /><br />Altogether a very pleasing sequel.
Here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another.
the Man From Snowy River III: The CRAIGS.
I'm sure we'd all love to see how Jim and Jessica are doing on their farm.<br /><br />The Aussie DVD has a couple of extra scenes in it.
Worthwhile if you are already a fan."
3217_8	"Kurt Russell is so believable and the action so non-stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest-to-goodness important themes [overcoming fear of The Stranger, learning to rise above early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the storyline.
This is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even I [who thinks most A/A is violent pap] liked the film and have recommended it to every guy I know.....it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action-adventure box office hits -- it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non-stop action moments.
I'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it.
Anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or not care about it.
This film could convert anyone who avoids A/A as mindless violence.
If a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable listing] to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks."
10314_8	"This one and \Her Pilgrim Soul\"" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone.
As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there's something lacking in this new series.
Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned.
It's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version.
However, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too.
I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite.
I remember I wasn't surprised by the Korean movie \""Il Mare\"" (later remade into \""The Lake House\"".
I think it's because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film."""

I was really surprised with John Abraham's acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face,so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully,by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar.
I was also quite surprised with the Akshaye's 3 girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly moaning about Akshaye's dissapearence(to the other girls) i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing ,also majority of songs are good,it is colourful and fun so on a boring Sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood."
1311_10	"This is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television.
I really wish it was on d.v.d.<br /><br />Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance.
She played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly.
When she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing.
She is so alone, so he gets to her.
When she talks about her mother! WOW!<br /><br />Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world.
It was Oscar-worthy.
When he talks about killing the kids, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene!!<br /><br />They really don't make them like that anymore.
It was a real thriller without being gory."
6359_10	"If you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation...oh well..but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic, you will love it..Jim Carey was incredible as usual.
The story line was great, a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better.
Ron Howard never misses a beat..But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show.
Try not to lose sight of that ..if you do you really wont enjoy the movie...and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do..its not easy as it looks ..."
3846_10	"basically, i like Verhoeven film because in his film, i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in \Basic Instinct\"".it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so it is obviously for me to watch this another Verhoeven movie.
<br /><br />well, it is his previous direction before his block buster hit \""Basic Instinct\"" and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah, the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation.
<br /><br />this movie \""The Fourth Man\"" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences.
the story of this movie is about a gay writer named \""Reve\""(Krabbe), an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture, he introduce a seductive woman named \""Christine\"", who has a mysterious past she doesn't want to reveal.Reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy.
next morning, he watch her sexy, macho boyfriend's picture on her table, the person he met at the station.
he is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her house.<br /><br />that's it.
i don't want to reveal the entire story because it is a Verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising!<br /><br />especially, i like the character \""Reve\"" which is brilliantly played by \""Krabbe\"".i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face.
<br /><br />i would like thanks Mr.Verhoeven to make such a black comedy.
<br /><br />i rate this movie: 10 out of 10."""
10189_7	"If any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one.
I've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling.
The movie was disturbing at moments.
However, the movie was terrible at editing.
The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place.
Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting (comically) with the police officers.
The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place.
On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning.
The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.<br /><br />I have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely.
Without them, this movie would not have an impact.
Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza.
She looks pretty in the first half, and I've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her.
What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date.
Nana Patekar was excellent as her father-in-law.
Not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him.
Deepti Naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene.
Though she doesn't have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good.
The other good performance was the little kid.
He was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes.
The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances.
Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do.
Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role.
<br /><br />One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina.
The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song.
And boy Aish is mad hot.
However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever.
People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they won't brag too much about it after-wards.
Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie.
Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about.
Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie.
Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see."

You couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />Cast is superb.
Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife.
She's both wanton, and criminally conspiratorial.
Every fellow's dream.
K'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding.
He's a genuine screen presence.
Very photogenic, and natural.
Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful.
Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona.
Billy Connolly is delightful as Fido.
A fine actor: I wish that he had played the title role in \Braveheart,\"" with Gibson directing.
My sense is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character.
His Fido is contained, yet accessible.
A nice touch.<br /><br />In short, a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions.
A true reality show."""
5240_7	"Some of the acting was a bit suspect.
I remember that asswipe Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yeah OK, he's now dead) launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying NI Protestants as murderers.
Now with respect to all NI protestants, this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists)and who roamed Belfast in the 1970's.
Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing.
my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope, it's all doom & gloom, i mean did the little girl at the end have to die.
Maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all Prods & tiags are bad or wholly good either."
9176_10	"This review comes nearly 30 years late.
Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that I chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight! I just had to write about it! I got smitten and forgot anything else existed once I saw this movie.
How ironic it is to see Literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man! yet, what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly and more so because Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role.
He delivered an astounding and triumphant performance! I have never seen anything like it! All the other actors are very good too.
The whole movie was put together beautifully.
I don't care what anyone says about this movie.
I just love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied.
It crushes me a bit to say this but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A&E's P&J, which I believe is the ultimate mini-series.
<br /><br />The excerpts from Jane Eyre spooked me a little back in school.
I never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well.
Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy.
The scenes and Mr.
Dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously, which, of course is a masterpiece.
Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr.Dalton!! This movie is now a part of me.<br /><br />I give it 10/10 rating."
11419_10	"Claire Denis' debut is both a brave and self-assured one.
In this depiction of life towards the end of French colonialist Cameroon, she explores the relationships between men and women, black and white.<br /><br />With the black servant 'Protée' as the film's primary object of desire and oppression, the film enters taboo territory from the beginning.
Denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen.
The mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera-work and (lack of) lighting.<br /><br />A great discourse."

What happened? All my friends were really surprised it ended.
We could relate to the characters who had real problems.
We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters.
There wasn't anybody on the show I didn't like and felt the acting was superb.
I alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas.

I'm not really a big fan of animated films, but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film I've seen.
The music is wonderful as is the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as the King Gator.

The Frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães).
Later, he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle.
In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat him.
<br /><br />\Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês\"" is another great low budget movie of the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos.
The screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi.
The film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic.
The actors and actresses perform naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance.
The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix.
This movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans, focusing in the Portuguese and French at that time, trading with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors by our natural resources.
This movie was awarded in the national festivals, such as the 1971 Brazilian Cinema Festival of Brasília (Festival de Brazília do Cinema Brasileiro) with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialog (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenograph (Régis Monteiro); Art Critics Association of São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other prizes.

2768_8	"Other than Susan Hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made.
Henry King handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes, and Peck is, as always, impeccable.
The stirring Alfred Newman sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years.
The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made.
This goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day, \The Song of Ruth\"" and \""Esther and the King.\"" It is worth watching, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the prophet Nathan.
The film is rounded out by the always fine James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's estranged first wife."""

Humor, talent, romance, and action all rolled into one.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra was wonderful.
Nothing else needs to be said.
Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson.
The fact that he couldn't sing added to his character.
The ladies in the film were alright, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show.<br /><br />It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age.
It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh.<br /><br />Definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed!"

i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame.
but frankly i like the \less violent\"" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now.
I thought it interesting that Belisario's Airwolf and JAG have similar theme - the lead actor (Hawke and Harm) both are looking for an MIA relative (brother, father).
wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme.<br /><br />Question - does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin.

4296_9	"This would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991, except it got beat out by the brilliant JFK.
This is such a wonderful movie! I loved it.
I love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives.
Kevin Kline is good here, but is outshined by Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin.
I've never much like Martin or his style, but here he is great.
I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end about the Grand Canyon.
The writing was excellent.
Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, along the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino.
Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out storylines, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives.
A truly excellent film.
4 out of 4 stars"
8375_8	<br /><br />Robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age.
You have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts.
So just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it.
1746_7	"Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way.
Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult.
This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun.
To be certain the pacing is a bit slack, more akin to one of Principals (the producing studios) features then a rip roaring adventure, but it's still enjoyable.
This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that \hey I missed something\"".

9655_10	"Maybe \Presque Rien\"" is not the best movie ever made...
But it is better than many of you have said.
I still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one.<br /><br />You Americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies, with a clear beginning, development and outcome.
But European movies are less narrative, but makes you think much and feel.<br /><br />Many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie..
The purpose of this one is not show us a simple \""summer loving movie\"", with commercial characters who \""fall in love and live happy forever\"".
Summer Holidays and beach are only a background, and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys.<br /><br />Maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie, because of its 3 parts, showed as flashbacks.
These 3 moments are: - Summertime in Pornichet, when they meet and love.
- After a year and half living together in Nantes, Mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself.
He tries to suicide taking something, and Cedric brings him to hospital.
Later, he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that.
- The last part, is when Mathieu come back to Pornichet, in winter, alone..
to think about how his life have changed, how his life become to be, and trying to find himself.<br /><br />It's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed among them.
But anyway, as I said before...
this is not a funny movie.
If what someone want to see is meat, for that, we have Belami movies.<br /><br />Presque Rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life.
Mathieu only wants to go away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness..
But what seemed perfect at the beginning..
later is not as good as he thought, and he become troubled, and feel that he has lost the way of his life.
He is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy.
He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide.
<br /><br />So, funny? Is not a funny movie.
Very hot scenes? only a few..
but this is not a movie for entertainment.
Is all about feelings...
friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness...
I, as many others, feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu, and that is what director wanted to do..
a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life.<br /><br />For me, the best homo-themed movie ever."""
2258_7	"I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort of Whoopi Goldberg.
Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina.
Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show South African history of apartheid.
Sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher's relationship with her student, Sarafina.
I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore.
I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers.
But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand.
Now while I don't know the other actors and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad that they filmed with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie, than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal."

While most TV movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it.
The cinematography was pretty good for a TV film, and Viggo Mortensen displays shades of Aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules.
Most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense.
I was kind of annoyed by Jason Priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a TV MOVIE! Despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious.

True, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work.
Jerry Van Rooyen's splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as one mysterious character states) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits.
A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema."

The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth.
Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset.<br /><br />What I really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery."

It is now only viewable in private collections, and via the British Film Institute at special request.
Very unfortunate, as Ian Holm's nuanced portrayal of the weary-but-determined Bernard Samson is superb; one of his very best performances.
The supporting cast, including the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are superb.
With Mel Martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife, and Michael Degen as the mercurial Werner, the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game."
1946_9	"I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2-3 years.
Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into the past of all the great Star Trek episodes.
For those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- \I like The Next Generation\"" the best.
That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation.
But to be quiet honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG.
Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG.
Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined.
Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! Endgame portray him as a husband married to an \""organic\"", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before Endgame, to disobey Captain's order and make \""human\"" mistakes.
Unlike DS9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that carried them with his personality.
Of course the rest of the Voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, Harry Kim and Tom Paris -- very natural.
I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan.
Finally, I'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for Kate! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain.
What a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our Cosmic expanse."""

The very first \proper\"" episode of Columbo, following two standalone pilots, \""Murder By The Book\"" is not far off classic status.<br /><br />Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, one half of a murder mystery writing partnership.
His partner Jim is the talented one, whereas Ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill for promoting the books.
As soon as Jim has decided he no longer requires Ken's marketing skills, Ken hatches a plot to kill Jim.
Except it's not a new plot, it's actually the implementation in real life of a murder storyline originally intended for one of their books.<br /><br />It doesn't take Columbo long to work out that Ken is the murderer, although unfortunately another murder has to take place (Ken romances and then kills a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction.<br /><br />Nothing whatsoever wrong with \""Murder By The Book\"", but it's not quite top-notch.
I would just give \""Publish Or Perish\"" the edge over this: both episodes feature Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but \""Publish Or Perish\"" is a fraction more tense and unpredictable.

10552_9	"Nothing is fantastic! Simple as that! It's a film that shouldn't work, yet does.
Natali stays in the realm of Sci-Fi, however this film is also a comedy.
Cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for Natali (at $7.5million! Woo-hoo Pa!) so with Nothing he scales down again.
This is low budget, independent film-making at it's best.
Simple, good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to Hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain.
Nothing is a film about Nothing and before you ask, no it is not anything like Seinfeld! Basically Andrew and Dave are a couple of losers.
They live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways.
Andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while Dave is Andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out.
Dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with.
By bizarre mis-fortunes however, Dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from Daves work-place incriminating Dave, and Andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout (Canadian humour people!).
As it turns out Andrew's house is to be demolished as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on.
Both Andrew and Dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling.
They are desperate and can't escape, and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white.
What has happened? Have Dave and Andrew died? They wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet.
No police, no demolition team, no angry girl scout mother! What happens is Dave and Andy discover they have the ability to \wish or hate away.\"" As it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world.
They are left alone.
The house is surrounded by nothing, which is portrayed as pure white.
So what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white.
The film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water, they begin to tire of each other.
They discover they can hate away hunger, which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say.
I can't reveal much but I must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold.<br /><br />This film is quirky, funny, interesting.
The effects are simple yet effective and Natali brings together two buddies from Cube, David Hewlett, and Andrew Millar to lead the film.
They have chemistry and also work very well.
They have to hold 90% of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background, yet it works.
Certainly I expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as Cypher did and it should appear on DVD in a year or two in the states.
Nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as Cube or Cypher it once again proves Natali as one of the best up and comers.<br /><br />Natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and I cannot wait for his next feature.
I prey to god he doesn't do the proposed Necropolis, written and directed by ADD sufferer, the ever crap Paul Anderson.
Vincenzo old buddy if Paul comes round to your pad, RUN!!! RUN LIKE THE WIND!! I hope and prey this guy doesn't take to Hollywood like Alex Proyas did (with the enjoyable yet pussy-footed, sugar coated, helium light: I Robot!).
Keep your eyes peeled for this guy.

7131_9	"This made-for-TV film is a brilliant one.
This is probably the best and favourite role by BAFTA winning John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C.
and Inspector Morse).
Tom Oakley (Thaw) widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died, and now he has been landed with an evacuee called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson).
As he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship.
Until Willaim's Mum (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back.
After Tom gets worried about William not contacting him he goes to London to find him.
In the end Willaim gets his home with a loving family (or Dad).
Set during the Second World War this is an excellent film.
It was nominated the BAFTA Lew Grade Award, and it won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama.
John Thaw was number 3 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars.
Very good!"
2431_8	"Famous was \famous\"" for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi-main character is in terrible peril, only to be rescued by the hero at the last second.
This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand.
But even in death, there is still a happy ending.<br /><br />The constant in Famous Studios cartoons is that \""virtue always triumphs\"".
Popeye always gets to his spinach in time, Baby Huey always out-foxes the fox, Little Audery always \""learns her lesson\"".
And some FS cartoons ARE really dark and depressing.<br /><br />You have to give them credit.
as much as I love Looney Tunes and \""Tom and Jerry\"" I don't think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount.
Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), editing, voices.
They were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer."""
3199_10	"OK, I don't really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they kick ass.
They just...
conflict with each other.<br /><br />For Example: Near the end of the movie, it shows Ricky and Julian telling \Patrick Lewis\"" to put the dog down and walk away.
Then at the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying that they've been in jail for 2 years.
In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian yelling at \""Patrick Lewis\"".
But in the TV series, they've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months.<br /><br />Also, they give us the impression that the movie's story line and the TV series' story line are connected (because of the yelling scene between the guys).
But some actors portray totally different characters.
Of course, Patrick Roach plays \""Patrick Lewis\"" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy.
Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series.<br /><br />Also (again...
I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash.
The thing is, they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway, other than the yelling scene.<br /><br />Sorry to keep on blabbing."""
3938_9	"Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like.
It is a fooler.
Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin.
But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him.
<br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor.
It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years.
When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect.
There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard.
He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War.
He goes forward into history.
The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous.
Definitely worth seeing again."
5629_10	I loved this excellent movie.
Farrah Fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart.
She plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger.
After being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own.<br /><br />Then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again.
Not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplace.<br /><br />I think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land.
They are too easy on these criminals.
It's time for more harsh punishments.
3368_8	"A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism.
Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini.
She has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid.
She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though.
Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide.
The reason? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer.
The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance.
Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend.
Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected.
The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever.
Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed.
This is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition.
Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement, things will change, someone has understood."
12319_8	"First things first, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed.
Now actress Wang Zu Xian, the one who played Xiao Qian in the movie, is 42 years old and well aged.
It's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old-school HongKong productions like this.<br /><br />The movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s.
The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing.
More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it.
It feels like a horror movie but ultimately it's not scaring, but only fun.<br /><br />I had the experience of translating the second script of \A Chinese Ghotst Story\"", and I thought that script was a decent write.
However when I saw the movie, I firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script, like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles.
However, it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining.<br /><br />If you have seen the Lord of the Rings, you will notice the similarities in this movie to LOTR.
The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch.
It's definitely a laugh-out-loud.
Bravo!"""

than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil...

this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest...<br /><br />Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalistic, weird but very special design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time...

6502_10	"Although too young to remember the first showing of the series (being just a baby) I later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's, just when I was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects.
It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, relating tales of his time in the Royal Navy at Malta and later in the Pacific.
Since then I have devoured many books and seen many television series about the World War Two era, with mixed opinions.
The British television stations are generally very good at producing these, as The World At War can easily attest, with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies.
I strongly recommend such titles as \The Nazis - A warning From History\"", \""Blitz\"" and the BBC series about Dunkirk.
\""Britain At War In Colour\"", with its companion series \""Japan\"", \""Germany\"" and \""America\"" are of a very high standard.
The World At War is by far the best and, despite its age, never fails to deliver.
There will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course World War Two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with EVERY detail would take more time and money then any other, even if such an undertaking was even possible.
What I feel I must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that The World At War can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable.
That certainly worked for me: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs.
Recommend to anyone with even a passing interest.
The series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative."""
11931_9	"This was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast.
Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed are well-cast in this charming movie about real-life angels helping the Angels baseball team.
You never know, it could happen.
I loved Lloyd's role in it.
He was hilarious.
The story is about turning your life around, as the kid's belief in Angels helped turn around angry, hardened, and embittered manager Glover see the best in people.
The movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams.
It was funny, charming, touching, and sad, all very nicely done.

1975_7	"It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip \Basic Instinct 2,\"" to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released.
It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful.
First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself.
In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend.
Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas.
\""Basic Instinct 2\"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor.
Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter.
She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure.
Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick.
She became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves.
David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless, giving a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character.
Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />I am not recommending \""Basic Instinct 2\"" as a great movie; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators."""
2342_8	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is \original.\"" It is a word not used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale.
Those not familiar with the British \""Carry On ...\"" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale.
I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts.
I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show a \""Harry Potter\"" atmosphere.
Maybe that's a good thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift.
It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute.
He teams with Chi McBride (\""Boston Public,\"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent.
Everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated.
He can't send her back and he can never touch her.
Boy, would that make a relationship difficult.<br /><br />I will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain."""
1678_9	"Sergio Martino is a great director, who has contributed a lot to Italian genre cinema and, as far as I am considered, his Gialli from the 1970s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire.
\La Coda Dello Scorpione\"" aka.
\""The Case Of The Scorpion's Tale\"" of 1971 is one of these impressive films Martino has contributed to Italian Horror's most original sub-genre, and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere, style and suspense.
My personal favorite of the Martino films I've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant \""Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key\"" of 1972, followed by \""Torso\"" (1973) and \""The Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh\"" (1971), all of which I personally like even more than this one.
That's purely a matter of personal taste, however, as \""La Coda Dello Scorpione\"" is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of Italian Horror cinema and suspense in general.<br /><br />The film, which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash.
Insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man's wife.
Soon after Lynch begins to investigate, a person is brutally killed, which is just the beginning of a series of murders...<br /><br />\""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail\"" excellently delivers all the elements a great Giallo needs.
The film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning, the score by Bruno Nicolai is brilliant, the plot is wonderfully convoluted, and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end.
Regular Giallo leading-man George Hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead.
Sexy Anita Strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead.
The includes the great Luigi Pistilli, one of the most brilliant regulars of Italian genre-cinema of the 60s and 70s, and Alberto De Mendoza, another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of Italian cinema.
Athens, where most of the film takes place, is actually a great setting for a Giallo.
The atmosphere is constantly gripping, and the photography great, and Bruno Nicolai's ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense.
Long story short: \""La Coda Dello Scorpione\"" is another excellent Giallo from Sergio Martino and an absolute must-see for any lover of the sub-genre! Stylish, suspenseful, and great in all regards!"""
610_9	"Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not.
When i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies.
And i was right.
<br /><br />Stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film.
It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie.
The storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Like every tale , it has some short of morality.
Therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey.
We also know that the true love is Yvaine and not Victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative.
<br /><br />I have to give extra credits to Claire Danes.
She literally shines in this movie.
Her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character.
Moreover, she and Cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable.
The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make Stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie<br /><br />Overall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.I was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards.
I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this."
8550_8	"Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler but after that the quality has dropped.
Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's).
It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'Mile' was just stupid and moronic.
Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex.
<br /><br />Anyway enough about the Naked Mile.
I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought it could take the series to a new low but I was pleasantly surprised.
To be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex jokes aplenty.
Yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance.
The Greek Olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious.
There are weak points though.
Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first, I'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part.
<br /><br />While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse.
John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new low.
First and foremost he lacks charisma, a Stifler prerequisite.
You really can't care less about him.
The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on screen! She shines above him as does the rest of the cast.
Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish.
<br /><br />Saying that the film does entertain and Coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny.
<br /><br />Overall this film is worth renting, get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at Erik 'loser' Stifler."
6018_9	"I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and I loved it.

All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative.
Happily I'm no longer in such a minority.
<br /><br />It deftly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.<br /><br />Appreciation for this magistral film has grown, and I'm glad about that."

If you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! Its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure.
Gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades.
She shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to.
<br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the hero.
how shocked are you? I never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! What the right role can do for you! He looks so good as the sensible, regal Mr.

Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment \big dummy that I am.\"" Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost.
The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed.
That scene alone is worth the price of admission.
This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character.

10910_10	"A most recommendable masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of Angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of giants, Mastroianni and Moreau, and the remarkable character play by Ilias Logothethis.
Gregory Karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his \tough\"" partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character, which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl (Khrysikou) and the man (Mastroianni), albeit hinted beforehand.
(Hence the spoiler.)<br /><br />Get your expectations straight! It's an \""art movie\"" in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention.
Not for spending free time, but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert.
Due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended.<br /><br />Dialogues are used sparingly.

Spoofing anything and anyone, like \""Mary Poppins\"" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense.

11833_7	"White man + progress + industrialization = BAD.
First nations + nature + animals = GOOD.
Simple formula.
Actually, in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it.
However, that being said, I think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone.
You may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won, er lost.
But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the Western plains.
(The movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there).

Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest.
I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work.
Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys.
All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised.
Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?"

The other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home, is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her Mom to claim she was molested when he doesn't buy cookies from him.
Oh yeah, the police are after him too, after the Mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him.<br /><br />Man, what a day.<br /><br />What if you could make all of this disappear? That is the whole premise behind 'Nothing'.
The two fools realize, the cops, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything disappear.
There's nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept I thought.
I also looked at the time of this, 30 minutes had gone in the movie, and I still had an hour left in the movie.
Could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes IS a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie.
But the two actors, whom are life-long friends with each other and the director, have such great repertoire with each other, that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do.
There are lots of supernatural elements, but it's more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing."""
760_7	"I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it.
The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick.
The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special.
The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in \Breakin'\"", but I have to say that \""Breakin' 1&2\"" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better.
It's a movie I will keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon."""
11085_10	I have been looking for this movie for so many years.
I saw this move when I was nine and loved this movie.
I called Disney all the movie stores and the net.
No luck.
What a waste it was a very good movie.
It will be missed:(
396_8	"Legend of Zu<br /><br />I remember well Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier.
Over one Christmas, on a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong movies, Zu Warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...<br /><br />In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films I saw as a kid that I can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from.
And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic prime.<br /><br />So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension.
Could it beat the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies?<br /><br />Well the answer is I can't say.
But that was because this isn't really a remake.
The stories (and styles) are almost completely different.<br /><br />The Legend of Zu tells of the story of King Sky, a lone warrior, whose master, Dawn, declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia.
Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma, and Insomnia has returned to destroy Zu.
Meanwhile White Eyebrows and Red try, with the help of King Sky, to stop Insomnia.<br /><br />The plot isn't one full of twists and turns, but had enough detail in it to keep me interested.
But I can see this film as one you either love or you hate.
The film is very much about the special effects, with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments, much like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero.
But unlike the other two, this film was one which didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful.
Nothing appears rushed - unlike Hero.
The backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes.<br /><br />The story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing.
It was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks', but generally each character had its part in the story.
But some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion, and I somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this.<br /><br />Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the film, but I couldn't say this film showed their best performances.
Cecilia Cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting, but it is still quite raw.
Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me.
Despite her very short role, I have apologise and admit to ogling!<br /><br />Overall, I have to say, did enjoy this film as much as I enjoyed the 'original'.
Given that both movies are made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in Hong Kong has changed over two decades.
And one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all, as much as apples are apples and pears are pears.<br /><br />Ultimately, both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right.
And I'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again.<br /><br />Two to watch, but not compare."
6077_9	"I don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played Othello, but I've never witnessed a performance of the play, on film or on stage, wherein Othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity.<br /><br />According to the biographical notes, Fishburne never received any professional training as an actor.
Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful.
Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, Fishburne's portrayal is focused more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance.
In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.<br /><br />The acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing.
(Even Shakesspeare, after all, can be improved upon, now and again -- and if that be treason, make the most of it!"
7120_9	"Most war films made in the US during WWII were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else.
I am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable.
However, because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films.
A perfect example was the John Garfield film Air Force--in which a B-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner.
When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true.
However, after researching further I found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor.
This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!"
1161_8	"It was extremely low budget(it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder).
However it does have a good plot line, and its easy to follow.
8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father Amanda is released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with.
The doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car.
But within the first 20 minutes of the movie Amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard.
Then she see's her neighbor Richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him.
She acts innocent but after another neighbor Buzz finds out that Amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill Richards wife Laurie (this is after Amanda and him get it on in the hot tub).
Then she stops acting so Innocent and kills Buzz and later on attempts to kill Richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for.
And you'll have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not.
Overall good movie, reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part."
10870_8	"Personally, I find the movie to be quite a good watch.
It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized.<br /><br />Not only that, it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture.
Nevertheless, the movie stays true to the real world, thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to any Triad/Mafia movie fan.
Another good watch would be Dragon Squad.
That movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there's more knives than guns (in fact I don't remember seeing a single gun)."
10999_7	"This movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named Digicorp.
This wimpy guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy.
He is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies' plans.
Instead, Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and pretty much being double-crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent.
How will Morgan get himself out of this? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan make it out alive? Wow! What a nifty movie! I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie.
It is very suspenseful and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive.
The scene where they put this horrible contraption on Morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening.
Morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished.
From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life.<br /><br />The ending, wow, the ending is incredible! The twist is so much fun! It left me gasping and cheering like crazy! Good performances from all around, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film!"
5018_8	if you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen movie.i think it is up there with mischief/book of love/high school USA/shout/calender girl/crybaby/ all great movies set in the lat 50s & early 60s and it has a wonderful soundtrack.not as many songs as in some of these type of movies but still great.it is all so very funny at times and has a great love interest.
all the young cast are great.i wish there were more type of these wonderful movies.my favourite movie of all time is back to the future when Marty mcfly gos back to 1955 well in these wonderful movies it stays in the fab 50s(early 60s) there are some movies of this type better than this but not many.
7258_10	"I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time.
The 1st time was on late night TV in Australia more than 20 years ago but I could never forget this strange and bleak film..<br /><br />Not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move - we just hear the thoughts of characters - is only one unconventional aspect of it.
<br /><br />Searching for a copy of this film I found out that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, it was not kept in any British TV or film archives, that it was never released on video or DVD, that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80's.
When it was first shown on TV in Australia there were no recordable devices for consumers.<br /><br />On the second viewing recently, I could see why it was unforgettable.
At times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a Harold Pinter stage play.<br /><br />Again, if anyone wants a DVD copy of this please email me and I'm sure we can work something out Regards Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)"
3416_10	"I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival.
I loved this, and not just for the obvious reasons.
Blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind Tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of Mount Everest's sister peaks.
Now, this kind of thing is usually a can't miss.
Inspirational.
Moving.
Pretty standard, right? And even if the film were just that, I'd still have liked it.
But it was so much more.
Blind herself, German Sabriye Tenberken established a school for blind children in Tibet, in a culture that sees blindness as a curse, as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life.
Many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives, and at best, are a burden to their families.
As part of their education, Tenberken shares with them the story of American Erik Weihenmayer, the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest.
She sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students.
Instead, he comes up with a plan.
He'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23,000 foot Lhakpa Ri and provide all the guides and equipment.
Sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts.<br /><br />Erik's team are mostly American, mostly male, and mostly sighted.
As experienced mountaineers, they're Type-A personalities, very gung-ho and goal-oriented.
Sabriye is European, female, and blind, and the students for her are more than a \project,\"" no matter how well-intentioned.
Additionally, the students are Tibetan, and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves.
As the expedition unfolds, they become pawns in between the two adult \""sides,\"" wanting to please both, while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment.
As an additional obstacle (other than being blind, that is), they are speaking English as a second or in most cases, a third language, and struggle to understand and make themselves understood.<br /><br />When it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience, and that some are much more coordinated than others,
 it begins to unravel Erik's original plan for them all to reach the summit together.
As both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude, decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain.
Among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability, and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults.
At the risk of oversimplifying, on one side are those for whom the destination is all, and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey.
I won't tell you how it all turns out, except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought-provoking stories I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The film also weaves bits of each climber's story into the narrative, and this was sorely needed, since once on the climb, the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut.
With all the drama going on around them, that wasn't surprising.
The backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking, and I found it very strange that I found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end.
This was contrary to my expectations, and another pleasant surprise.<br /><br />In addition to all the human drama to cover, director Walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen-deprived conditions herself, lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down.
As with all great documentaries, the filmmaker was just lucky enough (or smart enough, or prepared enough) to be at the right place at the right time, and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do \""what's best for the kids\"" as it does about the kids themselves."""
6380_9	"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought.
I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations.
True, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking.
The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo.
Milo believes in the fabled Atlantis.
Along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own.
Along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more.
The voice cast is great.
They surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent.
The music is nothing special but likable anyway.
The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough.
Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages.
I rate this movie 9/10."
1673_8	"A fine Martino outing, this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.<br /><br />For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate.
Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, enjoyable twists, it has to be said.<br /><br />Sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations.
A super finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all."
6269_10	"A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4).
Especially for such an overhyped film.
Perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of Bruckheimer fare.
Clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it.
Fanboys expecting an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away.
This is one for the more intelligent action fans.
It didn't even bother me Jolie appeared so little."
2107_7	"I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay.
Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies.<br /><br />If you are bored by today's special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening.
What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency.
There is nothing fake or pretentious about them.
Take Mr.
Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself.
Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart.
(OK, weired example.) <br /><br />Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable.
Yet still, I liked it a lot.
If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner.
in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart."
4681_7	"Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers.<br /><br />However, I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols' Closer.
One scene especially where Adrian Grenier's character is questioning Rosario Dawson's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen's character is questioning Julia Roberts, although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in \Love.\"" Also note that \""Anna\"" is the name of both Dawson's and Roberts' character.
Can't be coincidence.
Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's \""Reigen\"" so I'm not sure how this connection formed.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea?"""
10476_9	"My first exposure to \Whale Music\"" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, that I bought around 1993.
I was reading the liner notes and the band said the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarrington's book.<br /><br />I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! An amazing read! I have since re-read the book numerous times, each time finding some new element to Desmond and his desire to complete the Whale Music.
<br /><br />I found the film in 1996, on video.
I haven't had a lot of good experiences with Canadian film, but this one worked for me.
The role of Claire could have been cast differently, but overall I think that Paul Quarrington's vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen.<br /><br />Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius.
The movie deals with family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands.
I would strongly recommend \""Whale Music\"" to not only music fans, but anyone who has ever lost something or someone, and tried to find their way back to the world."""
12083_8	"Second-feature concerns a young woman in London desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son.
Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy--I end up feeling like a prisoner too--but this rather classy B-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic.
It's far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet.
Rehashing this in 1986 (as \Dead Of Winter\"") proved not to be wise, as the plot-elements are not of the modern-day.
\""Julia Ross\"" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!) but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax, which feels a little sloppy.

3724_9	"Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.
<br /><br />The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp.
We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general..
Great acting, and very memorable.
Also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam.
Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle.
The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell...
and it's futility.<br /><br />Fantastic film.
Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br /><br />Rating 9 out of 10."
10021_8	"This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces (\The Fall of the House of Usher\"", \""Dance of Death\"" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end.
It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, \""The Cat and the Canary\"", \""The Old Dark House\"", \""Night of Terror\"" and so on).
Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests.
He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences.
I won't go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries.<br /><br />Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.<br /><br />Dan Basinger 8/10"""
9725_7	"\How To Lose Friends & Alienate People\"" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities.
It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities.
The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a zany British journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York.
Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title.
He is uproarious, daring, and moronic.
But nevertheless for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat likable character.
Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the composed Alison Olsen, played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst.
However, Sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the Fantastic Ms.
Megan Fox.
This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on \""eye candy\"" material.
Sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co.
Those are the peak comedic moments of the film.
However, I think that Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison; even though Team Weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise.
Pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young.
Jeff Bridges was again building \""The Dude\"" bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez.
But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here.
\""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People\"" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy.

6237_7	"Oh my, from the box description I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool.
Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man.
Most, after directing this, would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder.
I confess to only watching the first half hour (for now).
Reading all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to.
Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but that's graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism.
What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? Seeing this in a theater with anyone I know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than I got through on DVD.
There's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker from Hell.
Whatever happens to her, it isn't enough! Soulless suburbia that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thrives in Lower Austria.
Oh no! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and here they are in suburban shopping malls?

5597_10	"\Le Locataire\""(\""The Tenant\"")is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky,a timid file clerk living in Paris,who answers an advertisement for an apartment,only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window.Trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella(Isabelle Adjani).
Trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and,at first,is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment.His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours,who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant's suicide.This film is great.Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia.
Plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall,or the fever dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics.The photography by Sven Nykvist is truly beautiful.\""The Tenant\"" is a neglected gem.It may be difficult to track down,but it is more than worth the effort."""

I say \""small\"" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a John Woo film.
Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three \""bad guys\"".
John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days.
The film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens.
Wonderful ending, very positive.

3794_10	"`Our Song' gives us the lives of the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer.
Adolescent summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is/was the same for us all.
A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school.
Welcome heat and idleness.<br /><br />But if this experience of adolescence is universal, the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe as foreign a country as any.
Young bodies carving new silhouettes...beckoning new territory...the maze towards adulthood.
The young mind coming into itself, speaking for itself, saying this is who I am, this is who I want to try to be.
It is/was always thus.
But this is how it plays out in Brooklyn in the late 90s.<br /><br />Jim McKay is the writer/director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him.
The opening title slide `A film by' seems to list everyone in the universe.
It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one.
[The closing titles also have some of the most on-the-money and appreciative credits I've read.] The vivid sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves to be especially noted.
McKay's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it's his three graces Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn.
They're the real thing, their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality.
This ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life.
It has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare.<br /><br />Hanging out with them, we don't quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in.
These are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life.
We are witness to the modern math of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed and solved.
Small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout.
Lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job - it's the only way she gets to spend time with him.
We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood.
In a connected scene, Lanisha defends her dad to her mom, and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return.
Later, the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy/funny kids are and more tragically, how realism hammers idealism these days.
And at the end, Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself.
We see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay.
She demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable.<br /><br />`Our Song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and enlivening, that intimacy can, in the next, just turn and drift away.
It's awful, but that's just the way it is, isn't it?"

I have to admit that it's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands.
So, this stomped me a bit.
Anyway, for all the John Woo's fans, there are helicopters falling down, explosions, gunfire as if it would rain, and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns, one per hand.
The cast is absolutely brilliant.
Going beyond Keira, which in this movie is a real tomboy, pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see, Mickey Rourke is back, with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body.
Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well, as a reality show producer.<br /><br />Let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape.
The talk show scene is \""disgustingly\"" real.
Anyone that watched that load of .
you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations.
As well as the producer, when Domino's mom says that the reality that should show Domino's life is \""trash; no offense\"", he answers \""I don't take it like an offense\"".
This movie portrays a difficult life.
Domino, coming from a world that didn't want her, Ed (Mickey Rourke), a bounty hunter \""not so bounty\"", Choco (the third guy of the band), which family is (using Ed's words), \""the correctional institutes he's been\"", and Alf, the driver/bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation.
This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born \""without the shirt\""; unlucky, violent, and with nothing to lose, excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives.
The intro of the movie says that it is \""inspired by true story .
more or less\"", so I couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true.
Anyway, going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been \""added\"" to make the film easier to see, and be classified as an action movie), the characters' story is too realistic to be \""edulcorated\"".
<br /><br />The interaction between the characters is various, well studied, and definitely not boring.
What hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (Lucy Liu, sober as never in her acting career).
It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story (and that's a story).
Probably, the only \""con\"", in a movie with a lot of \""pros\"".
<br /><br />All in all: This isn't \""SWAT\"".
The characters are crafted; they have an identity, a shape.
They have a name and a surname (not just \""Gamble\"" and \""Street\"").
It's the case to say, it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet."""
387_8	"This movie is good.
It's not the best of the great CG kung fu flicks but its pretty good.
First thing first, the story is actually good.
The whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool.
My problem is theres too many characters! It got very confusing when they switched scenes! The special effects were INCREDIBLE! The fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex.
This movie practically all computer generated.
The acting is superb, as always expected from such high profile players.
Ekin Cheng makes an excellent protagonist, loner character.
Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie.
I thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping.
The bad guy, the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening.
The music is also excellent.
To me this story deserve at least a mini-series and not just ONE movie.
Theres too much story to cram in 2 hours.
Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details.
This movie sacrifices story integrity for action.
I reccomend Storm Riders over this any day."
6917_9	"This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 \The Gun That Won The West\"" To cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession.
An Indian would sell his soul to own one...<br /><br />Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new, psychological depth to the genre.
The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father.
Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend, Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}, Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown {Stephen McNally}, the man he wants.
But with Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for.
The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins.
But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast.
As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.<br /><br />Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called \""psychological Western\"", Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past.
Tho shot in black and white {the only one of the duos Westerns that was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes.
The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City.
It's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.<br /><br />Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of Americas finest and most versatile actors.
The support cast isn't too bad either.
Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings.
There's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here, tho the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far.<br /><br />Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the script ready to run.
But Lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans.
For as great as a director that Lang was, with Mann directing {and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands} it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre.
Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced, but also in who they influenced.
The likes of Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes, and gleefully for the Western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.<br /><br />A big hit at the box office back on release, Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age.

8852_9	"Tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called Backstreet that \tragedy is like another character\"" in the film.
The same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up Tarantino- for Sidney Lumet's best work in years, a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved.
Kelly Masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here (it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end, and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount), but her script does convey character before plot, and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat.
It's bleak as hell, unforgiving as Satan, but also absolutely riveting 90% of the time.<br /><br />Chalk it up not just because Lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during, and mostly after the botched 'mom-&-pop' jewelry store robbery occurs, but because of the formidable cast assembled (which, I might add, is Lumet's specialty).
Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups, and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist: looting their own mother and father's jewelry store in Westchester.
Hawke's Hank involves another shady character though, murders occur, and suddenly it's tragedy on a Greek scale affecting the brothers and their father, played by a perfect Albert Finney.
It's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who, like in Dog Day Afternoon, are painfully human, flawed to the bone but only wanting love &/or things to be set right, and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs.<br /><br />In this case though Hoffman and Hawke are matched splendidly; Hoffman has, until the aforementioned last ten minutes, a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation, but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally (i.e.
with Finney or the car scene with Tomei) push his talents to the limit; Hawke, meanwhile, is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter, can't pay any debts at all, and is called a baby by his own father, and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he's not quite as flawed as his older brother, but who wants to pick a straw for that title? And Finney, as mentioned, is spot-on all the way through, making his turn in Big Fish look like child's play (the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic, his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half).
<br /><br />Also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing Marisa Tomei, Bug's Michael Shannon as bad-ass white trash, and Amy Ryan, Brian F.
O'Byrne and Rosemary Harris making brief, exact impressions, this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's perpetual downward spiral.
If it's not as mind-blowing as Serpico or Network or the Pawnbroker or 12 Angry Men it comes as close as anything Lumet's done since."""

It has some action, some humor, decent F/X and Bigfoot.
CG is used, but so are some practical F/X, which I like.<br /><br />Overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror/sci-fi and need a fix.
It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled.<br /><br />The acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate.
Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are \developed\"", but know that things will pick up.

The only two movies I can think of is \Enchanted April\"" (1992) and \""The Enchanted Cottage\"" (1945).
Both movies used wonderful actors not stars.
In both movies, all the actors gave their best romantic performances.<br /><br />\""Enchanted April\"" is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation.
It is amazing \""Enchanted April\"" was made in 1992.

6046_7	"I was pleasantly surprised by the film.
Let's face it; the premise doesn't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the night's flick, but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over.
There were no moments that I found uproarious, and I doubt any that I'll remember the next day, but this doesn't fail as a nice diversion.
What I found funny was watching it here in Peking with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like.
I told her there was a plot- three guys have to bring back some weed to London.
Hardly satisfying for her.
There is no mugging going on here for the camera which I'd been expecting after reading a number of the comments.
I do take exception however to comparisons with Withnail and I; not in the same league, and I doubt was it intended to.

11010_10	"When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration.
That didn't really happen, surprisingly, and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear.
But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.<br /><br />The story is of a Morgan Sullivan, who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called Digicorp.
His job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company, while under an assumed and false identity.
His home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing.
However, things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on, he starts to question who he actually is.
This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up...<br /><br />Twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated, and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable.<br /><br />It's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future, and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
2658_10	"Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film.
Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start.
It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes.
Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.
A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad.
Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant.
Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers)."
5260_10	"Yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there, but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it.
Tim Meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the Saturday Night Live show.
Whenever he would do this character on the show I would crack up laughing.
So after I saw this was going to be playing on Comedy Central one night I decided to check it out.
All in all I was farily impressed with this movie, because it wasn't meant to win any Oscars or become comedy of the year, but it did entertain the Saturday Night Live fans that love the Ladies Man character.
This movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come."

In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs.
There is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid.<br /><br />The lines are hilarious, and all the leads have never been better.
Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant.<br /><br />If you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!"

It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea.
Based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of China, Edward Burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore.<br /><br />Taking no political sides, this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth, the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities, the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles.<br /><br />Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore.
This is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues.
10/10 definitely!"
5598_8	"I can understand how fans of filmmaker Roman Polanski could love this movie- and I could understand how some could totally hate it (Ebert was one of the few who couldn't understand why people weren't running out of the theater).
After a first viewing, I'm not sure I could fall into either category, however as someone who can't get enough of Kafka and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia The Tenant is effective enough for its running time.
Or maybe not- this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a masterwork if it were a half-hour Twilight Zone episode, with Serling delivering the coda as Terkovsky (or whomever it might be(?)) writhes in his bed in bandages.
It's very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as Repulsion was, however it could be argued that there was more ambiguity, more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a sustained disintegration of character and location (and, quite frankly, a better lead performance) than the Tenant.
<br /><br />As it stands, The Tenant does have an intriguing premise, the kind that one doesn't tire telling about to other people: Polanski is a Polish émigré to Paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by Simone Choule, who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after.
But the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise; after a Saturday night at Terkovsky's with a few friends, there are complaints of too much noise.
It won't happen again, Polanski's good-natured but slightly nervous tenant says, but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair.
Soon complaints get registered against another tenant, but from him? Can he register complaints? This is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and the surrounding people.
As the downward spiral goes on, Polanski ratchets up tension (and, dare I say, black-comedic laughs) by showing Terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream- one of Polanski's strongest scenes from the period- and in finding teeth in the wall, not to mention the bathroom across the way (which, I might add, is always a cinematic lynch-pin of horror and surreal madness).<br /><br />But somehow, the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a would-be mind-f*** machine, with Terkovsky's tenants only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while:
 there's not as much suspense when finding out that they really aren't out to get him, which makes the paranoia more self-fulfilling.
At least once or twice I thought to myself as well 'why did Polanski take the title role for himself?' It's not that he's at all a bad actor, and he has appeared in several films and plays that aren't of his own direction.
But aside from being great at looking awkward and tense, like in the church, or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself, his transformation is less creepy than tongue-in-cheek, a test of himself to see if he can pull it off, which he doesn't entirely do.
Despite Polanski working at it well to look like the meek and frazzled Terkovsky, I could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality.
By the time one sees him in drag, it goes between cringe-worthy and true camp, particularly when he goes for the double-climax at the end (which, of course, is of little surprise).<br /><br />And yet there is pleasure for the film-buff and Polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters (Winters and Douglas do this the best, even as they have to strain through limited characters), 
and the unexpected moments like Polanski and Adjani getting hot and heavy during a Bruce Lee movie, or when he gets really drunk, or in one almost random scene where he slaps a kid near a fountain, are rather brilliant in and of themselves.
It's a very good film, and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many coffees after midnight.
But an essential film? Not exactly."

6928_9	"The larger-than-life figures of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart.
Although Stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (John McIntire, especially great) and outlaw Dan Duryea, who's even more despicable than usual.
The film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with Mann's pared-down, compositionally rigorous film-making.
His themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun, but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement, and are defined in Stewart's conversations with sidekick Millard Mitchell.
Mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns.
Instead of gazing at vistas from afar, he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect, complicate, or evoke the human characters' goals.
Just as mountains, caves, and rapids had to be accounted for in The Naked Spur, here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain, a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters.
(I would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer William H.
Daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day-for-night, open-range photography.) Not merely an adept outdoorsman, Mann presents an equally vivid picture of Wyatt Earp-patrolled Dodge City, primarily through scaled, multiple-plane staging.
The shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because Mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot.
Nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes.
One scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: Mitchell's telling of Stewart's motivation to Shelley Winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all.
Light without feeling insubstantial, intense without being overbearing, Winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold."

I remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no person could ever be as frightening as Lucas Buck (with a B!!) No one ever was anyway.
<br /><br />What annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box-set as when on TV.
Episodes in funny order, I kept thinking when does Dr Matt leave??? - they made it so confusing.
<br /><br />However this is not the writers, producers or directors fault (its TV people in background the money makers They still do the same - Just look at shows like Carnivale and Farscape they don't like originality in studios!!!!!)<br /><br />To finish - If you've not seen this and you call yourself a Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama..Fan = YOU MUST.

It has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person.
No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different.
The movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions, drama and entertainment.
For the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions.
I would recommend all to see the movie.
Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of Bollywood for the Page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper.
But this is not all, then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed.
Even she is fired from the job.
Then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do Page 3 again.
Not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie.

I think it's up there with his performance in Patton.

10319_7	"Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based.
Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously.
However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!
<br /><br />OK..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the
 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?<br /><br />The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!<br /><br />Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles.
Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman.<br /><br />Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the
 often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!<br /><br />Simply put, the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it.
Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)"

It is not just about the termites who have built and live in the \Castles of Clay,\"" but also about the other animals who use the mounds.
There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch.
It is a not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds.
<br /><br />I wish it was available on DVD, so that I could watch it again and show others."""
3186_8	"I find this movie very enjoyable.
The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humour is light and clean, and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out.
Turns out to be very nice.
The performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to David's sophisticated role was very charming.
I also find Vera's dancing very, very well done.
I find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly.<br /><br />For those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly."
9195_10	"I don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has.
I found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought the premise looked interesting so I took a look see.
I wasn't disappointed in what I saw; I was moved.
This story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes.
Sumire Iwaya, played thoughtfully by Koyuki, shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown.
No one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate.
So instead she substitutes a human, played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet.
This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet.
The difference; he can retaliate in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog.
As he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations how a dog might react.
She spends time with the new boyfriend, Momo gets jealous.
It's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - Momo is a dance prodigy.
Her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts.
Matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning, to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer, to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man, not as a dog.
In my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop.
Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too.
Neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo (the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy) states  we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last.
Watch this show with a open mind, it's worth it."
1250_10	"This might contain a spoiler, so beware.<br /><br />If it had been 200,000 thousand or two million people, does it make a difference? Sometimes I get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of (strangely very LOUD) Americans, but I have to remember that many people here in the US were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone.
God Help us for what we have done.
after the relative ease of what we did to the native Americans, and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race, you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's.
But now I see it is OK as long as our ends are justified to only us.
How then, can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will? We are contradictory and hypocritical, and I am ashamed for this.
I feel sorrow for the people affected.
They deserve justice and their homes back.
If this was done in my name as an American for my supposed safety, I don't want it.
I denounce these actions, and hope our global community understands that many Americans believe the American government is a runaway train of deceit.
No one is above the law.
I want my country back, and so do the Chagos Islanders.
Regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers, no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports.
We can't stand to be stuck in traffic, let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes.
'Not one of us, Brit and American alike forget what goes around comes around.
Don't buy into the fallacy that a simpler, more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed, and preserved - when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000, we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men."
4643_10	"I am currently on vacation in Israel for summer, and so was able to see this incredible film.
A bit of a warning before I begin writing: I speak fluent Hebrew, and so the Hebrew parts were no problem; however, about a quarter (a bit less) of the film is in Arabic, and I was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit.
This did not detract from my understanding of the film, but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater.<br /><br />After a year of American Cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships, it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest; yet, \The Bubble\"" surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting, witty dialogue, and relevant political climate.
<br /><br />The film opens on a checkpoint on the Israeli-Palestinian border; For the first few moments, we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on.
Yet, this is an important element of this film's strength.
The political situation, and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background.
Most importantly, Tel Aviv serves as a character of its own in this film.
It is constantly referenced.
Street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged.
The skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly, and ultimately the city evolves along with the film The film focuses on the love between Noam (Ohad Knoller) and a Palestinian immigrant, Ashraf(Yousef 'Joe' Sweid), with the societies of Tel Aviv and Palestine serving as a constant foil.
We always know that their relationship is forbidden, and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema.
The love is incredibly strong, and stands as the centerpiece of the film.
The secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong: flamboyant restaurant owner Yelli's ( Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider, Golan (Zohar Liba), is particularly a source of amusement.
The love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite, fine crafted works of art, and the cinematography is astounding: In the first love scene of the film, the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and dissolves into a shot of Noam and Ashraf.
This shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love.<br /><br />To give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy, but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate, so I will instead focus on the witty dialogue.
Even when watching this movie in my second language, I could not stop laughing throughout.
Lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven, and an analogy of Sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber.
This dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in Cinema.
The music used in the film is also particularly powerful.
Music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it, and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other.
Little elements like this truly elevate the film.<br /><br />I could not give greater recommendation to a film; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted."""
5865_9	Saw this on cable back in the early 90's and loved it.
Never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently.
Still find it a great Vietnam movie.
Not sure why its not higher rated.
I found everything about this film compelling.
As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro.
I can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in Iraq.
I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see.
The human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield.
Its brought home for the rest of there lives.
And this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way.
Excellent film.
12189_7	"Despite loving Rita Hayworth, finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler \symbolic\"" aspects of the cinematography, The Lady from Shanghai didn't quite work for me.
I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure.
And in a film that's mostly people talking with each other in various situations, that's quite a problem.
The Lady from Shanghai ended up at a very low \""C\"", or a 7, for me.<br /><br />The Lady from Shanghai is really all about Orson Welles' character, Michael O'Hara.
O'Hara sees Elsa \""Rosalie\"" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park on a carriage ride and hits on her.
Later, he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him.
O'Hara is a seaman from Ireland and the globetrotting Elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband, Arthur (Everett Sloane), a very famous and powerful California defense attorney.
They talk O'Hara into working for them, despite his initial reservations--it seems to him, and to the audience, that Elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with, and O'Hara doesn't want to get involved.<br /><br />Shortly after going to work on their yacht, a strange man, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), who says he's Arthur's partner, shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble.
Eventually, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme.
Foolishly, O'Hara agrees.
Naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble, and eventually, a number of mysteries are revealed.<br /><br />Maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that, so far, I'm not exactly a huge fan of Orson Welles, and here, he produces, writes, directs and consumes most of the screen time.
I haven't seen anywhere near the majority of Welles' work yet, but I've tended to like his later films better, when he became a bit more campy and performance-arty.
I love F for Fake (Vérités et mensonges, 1974) for example, and I even kind of like his performance in Casino Royale (1967), when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table, but Citizen Kane (1941) never did much for me, despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years (including about one year ago; my rating was a low 7--the same as my current score for The Lady from Shanghai).
<br /><br />Welles' performance and the dialogue he's written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me.
He's a bit of a motormouth, a bit of a boor, and a bit monotone--he tends to sound like he's reading.
His performance reminded me of what I've seen of Welles' version of Moby Dick (listed on IMDb as 1999, but \""completed\"" in 1971, it can also be seen in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995)), where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he's inherently, sublimely dramatic.
I'm also someone who almost never complains about accents, but somehow Welles manages to make his Irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me, too.<br /><br />As for the other performances, I can only say I thought Hayworth did an excellent job.
Of course she's gorgeous, which doesn't hurt.
Plenty of eye candy here.
Like Welles, Sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me--I never quite bought his character, his handicap and so on, and Anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn't seem to fit.
Welles often shoots him in close-up and Anders almost always has some over-exaggerated, manic expression on his sweaty face.<br /><br />Structurally, The Lady from Shanghai is very uneven.
The first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap-operatic, although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique.
Once Grisby introduces his scheme, things pick up a bit, and mostly improve as we near the end.
But by the time The Lady from Shanghai becomes a crime/mystery film, it's too little too late, and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden, thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence.<br /><br />The ending is more action-oriented, less-dialogue heavy, more varied and exotic in settings, and at times, fairly abstract.
Welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director.
If The Lady from Shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime/mystery stuff and the arty ending, it could have easily been at least a 9.
The final scenes are easily 10s, as Welles shifts from a Hitchcockian suspense scene in a San Francisco Chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a Chinese amusement park.
The funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time.
It's well integrated with the script, as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism.<br /><br />The cinematography throughout is interesting, even if it usually can't make up for the problems in the foreground.
Welles blocks scenes with skill.
There are lots of attractively filmed settings, from Central Park to Acapulco to various San Francisco locations.
Welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action, from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of Acapulco to the maze-like Caribbean streets, the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the San Francisco Aquarium, and so on.
The romance material, for which the Aquarium serves as one backdrop, is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film, but on the other hand, that makes the romance never quite work as romance.<br /><br />Surely serious Welles fans will appreciate The Lady from Shanghai much more than I did, and of course it's worth a watch if you love Rita Hayworth.
The Lady from Shanghai isn't exactly a terrible film, in my view, but it's dangerously close to not \""passing\"".
Proceed with caution."""
5289_10	"John Waters has made the most effusively buoyant, heartfelt, dark, personal little film I think I've ever seen (well maybe Fast Food Fast Women comes in close second) The directors vision is untainted...the narrative is whimsical, the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life ...the tone never forced or stylistically over-arch.
<br /><br />There is no pretentious shot design, ennui, or magazine grading....
Martha Plimpton is amazing as the sister..Eddie furlong is inspired casting.
A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea-bagging, recycled clothing, yesterday's garbage becomes today's art -- and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family ...
and a humble life."
9688_9	"I approach films about talking animals with care.
For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey.
Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential.
When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence.
But I found the film a pleasant surprise.
And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.<br /><br />A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory.
One day, he hears singing coming from the basement.
And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out.
Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk.
And not a few phrases either.
Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.<br /><br />The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha.
Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story.
Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter.
The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!).<br /><br />When Marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away.
And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly.
Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars.
Of a cage that is!<br /><br />Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s.
And although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.<br /><br />Jay Mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie.
He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck.
Paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way.<br /><br />Because he's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time.
And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes.
Only for those promises to be broken time and again.<br /><br />Paulie is admittedly a little episodic.
It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie.
He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners.
She sympathises with Paulie's situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie.<br /><br />Paulie is an occasionally very touching film.
His scenes with Ivy are some of the best.
Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers.
The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking: <br /><br />\There are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later.
But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.\""<br /><br />The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment.
And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over.<br /><br />Despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had.
Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant.
The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number.
And Paulie even gets to have a romance.
Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by Mohr as well).
That may be the only complaint I have.
As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves Paulie on to another.<br /><br />The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too.
I'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film.
And Paulie's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible.
He's caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he's remained ever since.<br /><br />The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie.
Of course they do find Marie.
But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes.
Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I believe its an equally brilliant film.
The same laughs.
The same flawless effects.
And the same surprising intelligence.<br /><br />A minor gem."""
2647_10	"This movie can be interpreted on many different levels.
Don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs.
It has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally made) is really not about that at all.
It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society.
It shows, for a split second, that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online.
Why? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people.
As far as the scene about logic, it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level.
You have to apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way.
One of the best movies I have ever seen.
It just might go way above your head; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem.
When you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review's try not reading the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)"

5617_8	"After his classic film noir homage Chinatown Roman Polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which, like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living.
<br /><br />Claustrophobic environments are the ones which Polanski is best at creating, and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created.
The emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever, and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed.
But The Tenant is not just confined spatially, but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist.
Trelkovsky, played by Polanski himself is not only in every scene, he is in virtually every shot.
When he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes Trelkovsky's point of view.
And of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror.<br /><br />I can't think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character.
Some psychological thrillers, like M or Peeping Tom, manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist.
Others, like Psycho, attempt in-depth scientific analysis of his mental condition.
The Tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply immerses us completely inside Trelkovsky's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head.
We feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational.<br /><br />Polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film.
Often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on, but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences.
Why? Precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia.
A much later Polanski horror, The Ninth Gate is a bit of a mess plot-wise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dread.<br /><br />This is a rare chance to see Polanski himself in a major role.
His talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it, and he is absolutely perfect as the meek Trelkovsky.
Another standout performance is that of the all-too-often overlooked Shelley Winters as the concierge.
In actual fact it is rather a stellar cast, although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange, Gothic European movie.
Also sadly many of the French actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the English language version.<br /><br />The Tenant is more polished and less pretentious than Repulsion, but it lacks the suspense and the character that make Rosemary's Baby so engrossing and entertaining.
The Tenant is good, with no major flaws, and Polanski was really on top form as a director, but it's not among his most gripping works."
3630_7	"As a huge baseball fan, my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears.
Dennis Quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher.
It is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much \Disney\"" for my taste."""
10086_7	"This is a lot of silliness about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon whom she barely knows.
It's full of cliches, and the Liz Taylor character is not believable.
It has a marvelous set, some exotic location footage.
It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty.
She looks stunning."
1970_9	"Finally, after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of \Basic Instinct\"", we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! I remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance,
 the sex, the interrogation, the music (by the master Jerry Goldsmith), and everything else from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kind! Make no mistake, \""Basic Instinct\"" was a real winner for audiences everywhere.
I can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel.
Five years later, we have it.
I never would have thought it to end up such as this.
When it was declared a dropped project, time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with.
Well, I guess we now know anything's possible in this case.
Even if the original director, or writer are not present, all we need is the glamorous, always reliable Sharon Stone, and we have a done deal! Please, hear me out...<br /><br />When people say that this film is bad, I think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme, and slightly dated.
I use the word \""dated\"" only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years, and audiences have become adapted to the pointless, boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money, and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly.
Who needs hole some and clean? Of course it's a pleasant thing to have, but c'mon! Escapism is really seldom these days, and \""Basic Instinct 2\"" gives us real fans what we've been expecting.
This film is not an Academy Award winner, nor does it try to be.
It simply delivers the die-hard fans what they have been expecting.
It's a film for fun.
Movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously, but this film is just loose and fun, not taking itself seriously, not too seriously anyway.
That said, I shall evaluate the film.<br /><br />The film is a fast-paced film from the first second, as we see Cathernine Tremell in a car, speeding at 110 MPH-and enjoying lustful thrills doing so.
Perhaps sex and driving does not mix, because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and...well, she gets away unharmed, but her studly partner doesn't fare too well.
Once again, Tremell is the primary suspect of the accident, and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists.
Dr.
Michael Glass (Morrissey) is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her.
Like another criminal investigator before him, he is entranced and seduced, slowly, and surely.
His denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do.
Tramell is possibly more dangerous now, than she was before,but like the first one, we'll never really know, will we? Once the seduction is in motion, jealousy, rage, drugs, and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues!<br /><br />This film does not recycle the first one, but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time.
This is a good thing.
It lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two.
Sharon Stone dazzles us again, as though 14 years has not come to pass.
Her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier.
Just awesome! David Morrissey is well cast, and manages pretty well.
The fact that a non-popular star was chosen, makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him, just what we see him perform.
My final thought-8.5 to 9 out of 10.
So it's not the first one, nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place.
It can, however, live up to the standards set by the first film, and it does folks! It does."""
6613_7	"A very unique Sci-Fi animated film, and frankly I love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be, better or worse.
This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technique part is innovatory, like \Waking Life\"" I recently watched.<br /><br />It took me quite a long time to get used to the Black-White style, but eventually I love it, the sketchlike images are really fancy! The contracted future world is a symbol of human race's final destination which I adore it very much.
<br /><br />The whole plot is fine for a Sci-Fi, not so intriguing but it's OK, like some Hollywood's products, a giant conspiracy about human's eternity, a little bit cliché and the twisted ending is not so convincing, some development is just too plain and insipid, and the whole movie is too long.<br /><br />So I think I'm just in love with the style this film shows, others are not so good.<br /><br />About the eternity of life, I think most people have come to a unanimousness that we
 don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos.
Leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but that's also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one's life and make the world colorful and lively."""
11046_8	"Maléfique is a very interesting movie.
It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures.
The central concept is great, three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth (who the audience identify with) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell.
<br /><br />The atmosphere is well-woven, it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes' in the Château d'If (prior to becoming the Count of Monte Cristo).
The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell, particularly the character we are meant to identify with (Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it's obliquely suggested might be fraud).
On one occasion Carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken.
There are also no shots of the prison outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall.
So even though the film appears to be very modern, it has a very old world feel of incarceration.<br /><br />The characters are intriguing.
We have Marcus, a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to Pâquerette (French for Daisy) a heavily retarded young man.
Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately this included his baby sister, hence his current predicament (I like this comment on internalisation, very primitive).
Lasalle is a withdrawn, possessed elderly man, in for brutally murdering his wife.<br /><br />The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you, and there's a ritual that goes with that.
I think that's what disturbs me the most, seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically.
It has a real life ring to it.
The quite simple soundtrack backs this up well, every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong.
I'm actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self-destructive.<br /><br />I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently, particularly with Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation either.
I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than execution, such as the famous \vagina eye\"", and the sodomy of Lasalle, for me, totally hollow images.<br /><br />At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with, and some things don't seem logical, for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about Carrère's child.
This doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird, a \""pure\"" horror movie.
There is no comedic dross or genre segueing, like Cube (1997/Natali), the obvious movie to compare it to, it's a total immersion experience, where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters.
This last comment I make about it being a \""pure\"" experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point.<br /><br />On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian.
He very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him.
The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge.
This prompts Lasalle to go insane.
That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge.
It's something I myself have felt.<br /><br />One final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters' names.
To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older librarian character, simply click on Philippe Laudenbach's page and you will see he was born in 1936."""
5050_7	"We really enjoyed Grey Owl: a simple tale well told in classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romanticized, with archetypes, humor, and a stress of dignity and values.<br /><br />Beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who turned native Indian, and went to live and trap in Canada.<br /><br />Solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing.<br /><br />Two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen - and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings.
It must have been great to meet or read Grey Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute."
991_7	"I really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie.
This movie was not intended to be a \deep thought\"" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be.
In fact, it would appear that if ANY movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2.
Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.<br /><br />This movie was an Action/Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be.
And for an Action/Comedy, it was very well done.
I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a Jamie Foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.<br /><br />The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc.
etc.
etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist.
Now the \""bad guys\"" are actually the \""good guys\"" and the REAL \""bad guy\"" is an uber-geek.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.
<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in \""The Matrix\"" or a drama such as \""Of Mice and Men\"" then this movie isn't for you.
But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you.
I would normally have rated it about an 8 (on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it SHOULD be.<br /><br />"""
11114_10	"It probably isn't fair that I have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten, but oh well.......<br /><br />From a standpoint of acting, how could any actor fail with these characters? Each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life.
Tony Soprano-while a mob \Capo\"" and suffering from mental illness, still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive.
Each of his men, you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism.
It definitely brings out a sort \""nosey\"" side in each and every viewer, and I include myself in this!<br /><br />While some above don't care for Bracco, I have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since Good Fellas.
She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason, that makes him decent, that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long, if ever.
She is simply put, his savior.
(Not speaking in religious tones)<br /><br />But the knockout performance here is without doubt, Edie Falco.
To see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed HBO series, \""Oz\"" and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress.
She has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress, something only actresses like Merle Streep can get away with.
A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles.
But as I have mentioned before, with a characters a strong as these, how can any actor fail?<br /><br />Livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself.
She is a survivor, as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors.
She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business, yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey.
She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself.<br /><br />All in all, the biggest crime from the Soprano Family is that we the viewer have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season.
This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series.
It was what brought The Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream On, and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them.
Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic.
Until then, I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled."""
9866_7	"Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film.
The story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.<br /><br />More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour.
Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality.
Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.<br /><br />Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how.<br /><br />Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny."
1983_10	"I saw this recently on a cable channel.
The movie is great; it's one of the few musicals I have seen that doesn't shy away from the light and dark.
It portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor.
Some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on, I didn't know where to look next.
One day I shall go and see this on the big screen, just so that I see what's happening.
But what really lifts this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes.
Not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else, some inner demons.
He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything.
It was almost as if the Sykes character was on the edge of madness, just awaiting the trigger.
I have seen the Robert Newton's Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was 'just' a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room."
1611_10	"The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which \Moonstruck\"" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood.
Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are \""yesteryear\"".
\""Moonstruck\"" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City.
New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes.
Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made.
These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in \""Moonstruck\"" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties.
One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie.
In \""Moonstruck\"", however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation.
All of the characters in \""Moonstruck\"" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity.
The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational.
All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so).
The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives.
Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'.
Thus signifying everything!! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello,
 and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in \""Moonstruck\"" Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for \""Cincinnati Kid\"", \""Thomas Crowne Affair\"", and most famous for \""In The Heat Of The Night\"" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say \""Snap Out Of It!!\"" This movie \""Moonstruck\"" is totally happy go lucky!! Totally eighties!! and Totally five stars!! See it!!"""
6587_9	"The Master Blackmailer, based off of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, \the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton,\"" is the first feature length Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett that I have seen.
The story is interesting and dark.
The film has a somewhat dreary, sad feel to it, but it is quite entertaining (with some especially funny scenes).<br /><br />*Spoilers* Sherlock Holmes and Dr.
Watson attempt to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has been ruining some of the most prominent families of England by publishing private letters that will, in one way or another, destroy their lives.
They eventually find out that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an \""art dealer,\"" after the few tragic consequences for victims that could not pay up.
Our heroes must next help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay a sum that is beyond her means or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off.
The scene in which Holmes and Watson burglarize Milverton's house are intense.
Although the film has an essentially happy ending, the tone is sad and regretful.<br /><br />Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a riot).
I give it a ***1/2 out *****.
My only complaint is that there wasn't enough Inspector Lestrade.
(I wish they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gives the description of the two burglars, one of which matches Watson.)"""

That's simply not true and a little unfair.<br /><br />The acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity.
I don't think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together.
Perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try.
I thought it made the film much more interesting.
Perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening, but that's about the only fault I can find.
Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance as Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone."

1783_8	"Criticism of the film EVENING, based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham, has been harsh, so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try.
The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth, that famous actors were given very minor roles, that the entire production was over-hyped, etc.
For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.<br /><br />Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name - 'Harris' - with her two grown daughters Nina (Toni Colette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson).
As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) - a marriage both Ann (Claire Danes as the youthful Ann) and Lila's alcoholic brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) objected to, feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), her housekeeper's son who had become a physician.
Harris, Buddy, Lila, and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now, 50 years later, as Ann is dying.
The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.'
The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons.
Yes, there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation, but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words, such 'holes' are understandable.
The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave, Richardson (Redgrave's true daughter), Collette, Gummer (Streep's true daughter), Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Eileen Atkins, Glenn Close, Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson, but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances.
The setting is gorgeous (cinematography by Gyula Pados) and the musical score is by the inimitable Jan A.P.
Kaczmarek.
Lajos Koltai (\Being Julia') directs.

It takes a little while to warm up to it.
The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-like charm.
After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries.
The characters all develop a quirky charm, especially \Richard\"".
Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I'd hire to play a raving psychopath.
He just seems to enjoy it so very much! Mixed in with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character, \""The Midnight Skater\"" zooming through the campus in a black hoodie, looking for all the world like a cross between the Grim Reaper and, say, The Silver Surfer.
These shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the Skater seem almost ominous.
The soundtrack features some very fun Garage-Punk tunes and the raspy, raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film's mood.
Thumbs upish, I say."""

Is the film far fetched? I don't know.
You tell me.
I've yet to meet Adrian Brody at the market.

6938_9	"For the viewer who comes upon it long after its making, \Winchester '73\"" has something in common with \""Casablanca.\"" While you watch it, you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre; then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film, and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great.
In other words, it's a seminal work.<br /><br />\""Winchester '73\"" is a joy to watch.
The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you.
The dialogue, the pacing and Mann's direction are excellent.
Stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan this is a \""must-see,\"" but he is not alone in delivering a good performance.
Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and/or witty lines go to minor characters.

5504_10	"I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series.
It has been screened recently (Sept.
2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others.
It is a quite remarkable film.
The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself.
Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded.
They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens.
They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup.
As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be.
What we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be.
What we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy...
a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people...
a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader...
and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />"

My all-time favourite actor, Robert Culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system, kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis.
The teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of Dragnet look evenhanded by comparison.
But what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie, building the fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole California setting.

What was truly interesting was how political it was, maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration.
Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde, who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity.
What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown.
We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often, letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can't believe the contrary.

2252_10	"Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in US history.
However, to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film.
In my opinion, Hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of film release.
In often subtle filming and dialog delivery, he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes.<br /><br />I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950's.
That was just over 10 years after the films release and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who Mormons were.
I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film.<br /><br />1.
Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2.

11238_7	"Hidden Frontier is a fan made show, in the world of Star Trek.
The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta-quadrant .
It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original to the show.
The show takes place on the star base Deep Space 12 and on several space ships, which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have.
The characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have.
The show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors.
Not all the actors are equally good, but most do fine.
The episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes.
That is a bit more like in Babylon 5, than in most official Star Trek shows.
Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using.
All in all I enjoyed watching it."
4633_9	"Here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox.
The movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv.
The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well.
For example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room.
Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected.
A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment.
As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences.
The film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelies and Palestinians inflict on each other.
If you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie.
Though the plot is melodramatic, it's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be."
8660_7	"This is a racist movie, but worthy of study and enjoyment.
First time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad.
They have a relaxed, peaceful thing going, what with her still at home about to graduate from high school, and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something.
Second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar.
He takes it, it's the thing to do these days, and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather.
In that same scene the sister's blues song is a real tear-jerker if you're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music.
Her performance feels like the climax of the story; a blues story with the good guys being \people of color\"" in their element in backwoods, SC.
Meanwhile, all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies.

7167_9	"I couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short \Not bad\"" commentary.
This movie is much better than just not bad.
The acting is stellar, even from the children in the cast, who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends.
The movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well.
The double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler.
I watched this movie with my kids and then I watched it again by myself a few days later.
If you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then check out \""Holes.\"" My 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the two of them.

I particularly loved Marzipan's, the tutu was adorable.

the tree, the bed, etc.), and I quite enjoyed the rats.
I love how they didn't make them scary, but cute and huggable.

It would barely make a difference if he was butt naked! And secondly..
why on EARTH did they have to make Culkin's outfit PINK?"
4930_7	"\Panic in the Streets\"" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed by it.
The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it.
Its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been.
The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down.
None of the central characters are really compelling or believable.<br /><br />Fortunately, the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting.
The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace.
There are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax.
When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong.<br /><br />The acting is also very good.
Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character.
Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well.
The standouts in the cast are the two villains.
Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters.
Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain.
\""Panic in the Streets\"" is disappointing but still worth watching.

3345_9	"What I expected: A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.<br /><br />What I got: An even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- 
that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.<br /><br />Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works! Barrymore is classic Barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong, and adorable.
We expect that from her and she delivered.<br /><br />But Fallon is the nice surprise in this film.
He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life, like caring about kids and his girlfriend.
Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection.
He can be caring (\You just ran across the field for me!\"") and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the Red Sox (\""How did the grass feel? Kinda spongy?\"") at the same time.
Fallon's portrayal \""made\"" the movie.
Hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (i.e.
Will Ferrell).<br /><br />In short, a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs.
female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon.<br /><br />Hey, I saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as I did.

6809_7	"This was a pretty good film.
I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I didn't want to take a chance.
Anyway, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a Scripture verse and then quotes another from memory.
I can't remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is Genesis 9:6.
He says it's Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6.
This is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment.
It's too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the Bible today.
Did anybody ever hear of John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books.

1215_10	"This is my favorite of the three care bears movies.
Once again I liked all the songs.
The big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original.
For those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their \cousins\"" who they apparently never knew about.
It wasn't of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared.
In this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along.
That being said this isn't a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first.
I thought the Darkheart character much more evil then the Nicholas of the first.
But at the same time I felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears.
I also liked the we care part at the end, although I know other people had mixed feelings about that scene.
And of course I LOVED the songs.
My favorites being Growing Up and Forever Young.
The care bears movies have always had such good songs.

I eventually forgot about and almost a decade later, I happened to think about it again.
Then went and bought both acts.
They were even better than I had experienced at first.<br /><br />My only complaint is that while the Tank Police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime, warranting tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals.
That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time.
If that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly has not been shown as such.<br /><br />I don't think the original Japanese version could have been any where as good as the Americanized version of this.
But regarding the story, there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused."
4046_8	"Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution.
One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary.
If you can put aside Rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not an easy thing to do, given that, for instance, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie.
Lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century France, Rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards.
It is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works.
And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be."

1461_10	"The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his American counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken Americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in New Orleans.
<br /><br />The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like $0.10 per hour to do so.
You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor.<br /><br />I have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them.
I just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact American indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world.
Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart.

6720_9	"Riding Giants<br /><br />This documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, its follow-up Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son, and Step into Liquid (IMAX).
I saw the first, not the others.
<br /><br />While the surfing footage is spectacular, I valued most the film-maker's historic perspective.
He takes us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it evolved to its present form.
This includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were most frequented by the world-class surfers, and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them.
The athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary bunks, fished for food, and went back out on their boards the next day.
What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days.
<br /><br />We see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start.
What was the biggest boost to the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the Beachboys' surfing songs like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA.
The Surfing magazine and Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions.
We also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s.
One such story is how 40-year old Laird Hamilton, considered today's greatest surfer, bonded with an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his single mom, who he married before becoming his step-dad.
<br /><br />A rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story.
Have I whetted your appetite? Wonderful.
Have a great ride."
11567_8	"In the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors, given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films, so it's interesting that this one should star Shirley Temple, who had long since established herself as The Most Famous Child Star of All Time.
Then again, she probably wasn't the one being tested, I would imagine that would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirley's brother Sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance.
Then again, a 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to accompany.<br /><br />The film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling, which I suppose was designed to have Shirley Temple give a scornful look at the ceiling, illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie, and provide a clean transition into the next scene, which features Shirley gleefully stomping in the rain.
<br /><br />It's Sonny'y birthday, and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog that he really wants for himself, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since.
It's curious that, when his father insists on getting a dog, Sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house, and as he is running away with no destination in sight, it's also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today.
<br /><br />Sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks (right after a train flew by which, given how close to the tracks he was, you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks, but no matter).
After Sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy, he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie.
It's interesting to consider what a longer film would have done, because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end.<br /><br />Not that that matters, Sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it, and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs.
It might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs, but of their lack of power over him.
As soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear.<br /><br />Hey, if that's all it takes, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I'm set! <br /><br />It's a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to, but it's cute enough and enjoyable enough (and short enough, as it were) to still be a fun movie.
We already don't expect an epic plot in a 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time.
And it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud.
I am hardly an expert of Shirley Temple's films, but it's not hard to see how she became The Most Famous Child Star of All Time."
2153_9	"This movie was charming.
An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success.
What makes it work so well, and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming \Great\"" it is simply about finding a way to express one's self.
The big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest, not the discovery of a whole new life style, but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life.
No one is discovering their passion, they are finding their quiet soul.<br /><br />The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and \""secret life\"" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal.

If, like myself, you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm (i.e.
not just another glut of generic sequels) then I think you may enjoy this.
When the bad guy eventually turns up in person, he was definitely not what I expected to see! All in all, I wouldn't go out of your way for this one, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, I guess.

12227_7	"I searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging \Clueless\"" (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best known effort from early in her film career.
\""True Crime\"" has Kevin Dillon, which should be helpful in improving most film projects.
In fact everyone in the cast does a good job .
The only disappointment I think the movie has for me is an awkward \""feel\"" to some of the scenes, coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising, grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure.<br /><br />Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this one.
She carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects Mary Giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders.
I reckon her characterization of MG has some mileage in it too.
The inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement.
It could be really interesting for an older Silverstone to revisit Giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer's life.
Just a thought!<br /><br />\""True Crime\"" shows its director in a good light.
Pat Verducci also has the writing credit.
I don't know of any other film work PV has done.
I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.<br /><br />Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown supporting cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly that.
Over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances.
I recall seeing him recently in \""Carriers\"" (1998), a made for TV presentation with a military theme.
Bill Nunn played \""Captain Arends\"".
Fans of the classic US TV comedy show \""Who's the Boss\"" may also have an interest in \""Carriers\"" because the leading player is Judith Light, remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show.

The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger...
while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards, in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken.

When the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police, you almost believed it was possible.<br /><br />If you are a fan of some of the better sex farces (Canadian or not) you should definitely seek this one out.

563_10	"The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), The Far Country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way.
This time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire's larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order.
Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims...<br /><br />While it's no great surprise which way Stewart turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem.
For most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and McIntire, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him.
In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature, there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is.<br /><br />As usual with Mann there's an exceptional use of high country locations, though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground, and the film is almost perfectly cast
 with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though Corinne Calvert's young romantic interest veers to the irritating).

That is the one show that I wish I could see again.

12486_7	"Well, this film is a difficult one really.
To be straight with you, this film doesn't contain much of a riveting story, nore does it make u 'want' to know how it'll end...but I'll tell you something now...never have I been as tense and jumped up before in my life! This film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills! To be fair, I did watch it at almost midnight so I was kinda sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was jumpy...
or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect!
 It's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event.
They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains...all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (i think it's it's the sister of the main character, and she brings along her husband)...during the night, the husband hears noises...
checks it out, and thats when things start to go really really wrong...they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn't right...to cut a long story short...eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of.<br /><br />It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore does it have a huge budget, but please don't let that put you off.
It's creepy, tense and very very jumpy! Just give it a try :)"
3431_10	"Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen, although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi.
Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia.
But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time.
In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent.
Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries.
But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance.
(And many of them still do...at least on some level...) <br /><br />Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script.
The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the best known Estonian actor, plays Snaut in Tarkovski's Solaris), playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life.
But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger, a child-actor playing Terje, a boyish girl in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is quite essential.
(and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list!!!)w<br /><br />There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time.
But Tallinn Pimeduses does that.
Unfortenately Järvi-Laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements.
His first one, Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night was just a weird mess."
8275_10	"Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes.
The acting is good, the characters act like a normal family.
The Wendigo effects are good, the Deer Form reminded me a little of the Rabbit in Donnie Darko.<br /><br />The film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer, a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named Otis starts to argue with the Dad George, after the car is lifted they drive off to the house.
The Son Miles is a little shook up about the Deer but his Parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen.
That night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom, the next day they go into to town and Miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the Wendigo, when Miles shows Kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there.
Once returning home George takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and Miles is chases by the wind, after gaining conciseness they go looking for George, they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot, in the Hospital Kim tells the Sheriff that Otis may have shot him, the Shrieff goes to Otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer, as Otis drives down the road he finds that the Wendigo is after him.
<br /><br />Wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments.
Check this out.

11668_7	"By 1945, and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces, Errol Flynn’s hold over U.S.
box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name: the swashbuckler.
The first of these was a good one actually – ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) – but it also proved to be his last big-budget Hollywood starring vehicle.
The rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the little-seen CROSSED SWORDS (1954).
However, Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers ‘A’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak… <br /><br />Still, the glorious Technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and, while an older and flabbier Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-headed leading lady Maureen O’Hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady.
Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles, so here he is typically seen as the baddie – the pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto.
Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) – a viewing of which preceded this one – AGAINST ALL FLAGS takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant TV viewing when vintage Hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring Italian channels.
<br /><br />For all I know, this might well have been the very first pirate movie I’ve ever seen and I cringe at 
the thought of today’s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is what buccaneering is all about! As I said earlier, AGAINST ALL FLAGS might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it’s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same.
Nowadays, the amorous persistence of the child-like Indian princess (Alice Kelley) towards her pirate captor Flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it – despite clearly not scaling the heights of THE SEA HAWK (1940) and THE BLACK SWAN (1942), to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars – is briskly paced and reasonably engaging.
Incidentally, the film would later go on to be remade as THE KING’S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! <br /><br />For what it’s worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD and, as a matter of fact, AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out “Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection” set from 
Universal which also consisted of obscure dross like BUCCANEER’S GIRL (1950; with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O’Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952; with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, perhaps but, so far,
 I have only acquired the Errol Flynn flick from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in future, I might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like Edward Dmytyk’s MUTINY (1952), the afore-mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961)."
4251_9	"I liked SOLINO very much.
It is a very heart-rending story of an italian family moving to Germany.
And it's an story about brotherly love, hope and disappointment.
And the film is never boring.
Go and see SOLINO!"

Can't say much about this film without giving away the story.
I can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture.
Everybody has his or her own agenda.
Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises.
Well written with good performances by all.
7240_8	"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of \The Lost Boys\""(1987).To my surprise \""To Die for\"" is a really good movie.It's a little bit corny at times,but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.
This is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.Highly recommended."""
8998_10	"This movie for what it is, may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day.
Made on a super small budget, the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films! IF you have a chance watch it!"
8871_10	"This was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues.
It dealt with issues of rascism and class.
But, it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself.
This movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny.
It also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society.
What others think of you is not important.
I believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it.
The actors I think were able to convey each character wonderfully.
I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was.
At a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is, but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie."
2097_9	"This movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed.
The book by Rebecca West was written in 1918, soon after WWI, when shell shock and trauma-induced amnesia were not clichés, as the reviewers call it many books and movies later.
It is difficult to go back in time and live, as the characters lived, the realities of the time: the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas, the British class system the wife thought all-important, the hopeless spinster, and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago.
<br /><br />Alan Bates as the amnesiac soldier who \will die\"" if he isn't allowed to see Margaret, the girl of his youthful dreams, builds on the devotion his character showed in \""Far From the Madding Crowd\"".
Having seen that performance, it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn't live up to the family's and society's expectations.
Margaret says, \""We quarreled, and as you rowed away, you turned your face away from me.\"" So we know that the breakup was something that he instigated, that it brought him shame, but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with Margaret.
I haven't seen all his films, but in the ones I've seen, he imparts a strong masculinity, which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier.<br /><br />I didn't even recognize Ann-Margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated.
Not having read the book, I wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between Jenny and Chris, though Jenny does state that she \""is a cousin\"".
The way Kitty keeps Jenny in the nursery in the hair-drying scene, the fact that Kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for Kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun, or sentiment about a lost child, and the statement she made that she wished Chris hadn't 
felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child.
Also, Jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role, as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time.<br /><br />Having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover (non-sexualin keeping with the mores of the time) from 50 years ago, I couldrelate to Margaret's and her husband's dilemma.
I, too, was cast aside because I wasn't good enough for his family, and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet, I was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying Vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved.
My husband, like Margaret's was very understanding, but the strain was very real.
The lover was finally able to reconcile his real-life situation with his fantasy of loving only me.<br /><br />I thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in Chris's mind.
I thought of \""Mrs.
Dalloway\"" with the WWI soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus Chris's joy in his fantasy of Margaret.
In contrast, the actiona of the soldier in \""Mrs.
Dalloway\"" seems overwrought.<br /><br />Showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to Chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced.
Everyone seems to get their life back, but was it the right choice?"""
8656_9	"In the same vein as Natural Born Killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved, Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act.
Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good.
David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I don't know where, places where nudity passes for art.
Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it.
At any rate, Brian and Carrie (Duchovny and Michelle Forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites.
Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take the pictures.<br /><br />Being artistic types, Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis).
Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation.
Two birds with one stone, you know.<br /><br />The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type.
Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals, but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele, Brian is fascinated with Early's status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early's gun.
Never having fired a gun before, he's as fascinated as a little kid.
While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early \broke her\"" of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink (Early doesn't think women should), Early and Brian are out at the local bar.
Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy.
\""Hit him, Bri, it's comin'.\"" This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them.
And besides that, because Brian benefited from Early's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele, it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.<br /><br />Clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues.
On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes.
While studying the actions of past murderers, Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.<br /><br />I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor.
Consider, for example, his roles in movies like Kalifornia, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and Ocean's 11 and 12.
Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character, and is completely believable.
Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right.
I even got the hat right, which initially I thought would be the hardest part.<br /><br />It's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter.
A film that didn't glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as Kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly.
The glorification is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele.
The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real."""
7437_10	"Recently, a friend and I were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950's versus today.
She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who, in 1798, wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner.
Both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in English Literature courses in college.
My friend said, \Its messages even might be called metaphysical within today's context.\"" <br /><br />We tried reciting it and only remembered bits and pieces.
(I have problems remembering Dr.
Seuss.) I said I'd get two copies of the poem so each could read it.
That was easy enough, but I was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film.
We looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted.
After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner isn't exactly light reading.
After each had read the poem, we watched the film together.<br /><br />We considered the film a remarkable achievement, especially considering it was made in the 1970's, before computers, before the so-called \""Ken Burns effect,\"" and before special effects too often began compensating for a lack of substance.
Particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations culled from \""lesser known artists,\"" such as Willy Pogany, the early Hollywood designer.
<br /><br />The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, whom had taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster, adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem.
<br /><br />Its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages, conveyed without \""instructing,\"" or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale.
We found it such a refreshing change from today's 'in your face' and 'clobber them over the head' mentality.
Most of today's morality messages in film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and mayhem mark the bad.
The bad are really, really, bad, and good are super heroes.
It is as if human character lacked any nuance.
The Rime of The Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, of character, of an appreciation for celebrating all the richness life has to offer, within the larger context of humanity, i.e., man's capacity to give to others.
<br /><br />Proud of ourselves for having found this \""unknown\"" gem, we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at \""name\"" international film festivals.
Another surprise was learning the film's director, Raul daSilva, is a recognized authority on early animation, and authored six award winning books about film.
<br /><br />This film's message is just as relevant today, if not more so, than when Coleridge penned the original epic poem and when Raul daSilva translated it to film.
If I still was teaching high school, which I did for five years, I'd grab this one and show it to all my students.
There's a level of richness here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face, whether in 1798, 1978, or today--in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component.<br /><br />Highly recommended."""

Do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.<br /><br />OK, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film.

6886_8	"This is unlike any other movie, the closest thing I can compare it to is a Woody Allen film...
But where as Woody Allen is constantly fathoming human foibles Bret Carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse.
In the Case of Lou, it is the root cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs.<br /><br />There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I believe they all deserve a chance for redemption, although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or Breasts.

It is an incoherent mess.
It's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - IS there a word in Spanish for \""Continuity\""?) and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get-up ambling about in long shot.
<br /><br />The music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded.
(Thinking about it, it might not have been a duet.
It might have been a solo.
The piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other.) <br /><br />This is one of the most bewilderedly trance-state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me.
Enjoy.<br /><br />Favourite line: \""Ilona! This madness and perversity will turn against you!\"" How true.<br /><br />Favourite shot: The lover, discovering his girlfriend slain, dropping the candle in a cartoon-like demonstration of surprise.
Rank amateur directing there."""
11577_8	"This was a really cool movie.
It just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie.
It traverses continents in seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, samuari fight on sinking galleons, David Essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the dude.
I enjoyed this movie but I like s**t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s**t movie that just KICKS ASS.
If you like Battlefield Earth you'll love this film, its swashbuckling, its fast, its silly, its samuaraitastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />It also looks as if it was made in 1972"
6173_8	"A great film.
The acting - from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; i thought soni razdan(mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee(saurabh) were the best of the lesser known actors.
Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who might be accused of overacting, presented quite a believable and familiar character.<br /><br />Another great thing was the camera work - and the way it captured the energy of bombay streets, the tranquility of gustad saying his prayers and life within the tiny apartments.<br /><br />I liked the story of the wall that becomes a shrine and then gets broken down - and the artists philosophical take on it.
<br /><br />It's great to see good movies on indian themes."
8923_8	"The Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi flick.
You probably know the story: two teens (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man with some weird...blob attached to his arm.
They take him to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened.
From there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path.
The special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story.
There are a lot of great touches, like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district.
It's no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre.
Steve McQueen is very good.

8268_7	"This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918.
And, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD.
Both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency.
In this film, William Haines is \Tom Brown\"" and his main rival, \""Bob\"" is played by Frances X.
Bushman.
And, in a supporting role is Jack Pickford--always remembered as the brother of Mary.
Of these three, Pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clichés are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises.
However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.<br /><br />In my opinion, for a better silent college film, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown.
THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era.
Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others)--and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all.
Well made, but certainly NOT original! And, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920!! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess."""
7368_8	"i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had.
only £300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself.
although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story, the more sadness you feel.
more so towards Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned.<br /><br />this is one of my favourite British films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again.
i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all."
12021_9	"This hard-hitting, often violent western in the Peckinpah/Leone tradition is surprisingly directed by Andrew V.
McLaglen, whose previous westerns (particularly those that starred John Wayne) were mainly in the John Ford mode.
It is both surprisingly traditional (good guys/bad guys) and incredible up-to-date as well.<br /><br />Heston portrays a former captain of the Arizona territorial police who has been in retirement for a year, having turned over the law enforcement reins to a reform-minded sheriff (Michael Parks) and finding his ways of enforcing the law being taken over by autos, telegraphs, telephones, and the railroad in the first years of the 20th century.
But soon he is confronted with a menace from his past--a half-breed outlaw (Coburn) that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards.
In a subsequent shootout, Coburn's wife was killed; and so Coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge.
It involves the kidnapping and, eventually, the rape of Heston's daughter (Hershey) by him and his gang.
The result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona.<br /><br />THE LAST HARD MEN, based on Brian Garfield's novel \Gun Down\"", is violent in many places, including the showdown between Heston and Coburn, and the rape scene involving Hershey and two members of Coburn's gang (Quade, Paull) is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE.
But that doesn't detract too terribly much from the film's psychological approach to the western genre.
McLaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant panache, and Heston's performance as an aging lawman was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his 1970s films.
Coburn makes for an especially cold-blooded heavy, and both Parks and Chris Mitchum (as Hershey's intended husband) do good turns as well.
The music here is cribbed from Jerry Goldsmith's scores to 100 RIFLES and the 1966 remake of STAGECOACH, but it still works here.<br /><br />Wisely filmed totally on location in southeastern Arizona, and utilizing the Old Tucson set, THE LAST HARD MEN needs to be released by Fox on VHS and/or DVD soon.
It is a western that deserves nothing less."""
9375_10	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor.
This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances.
\Red Rock West\"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my favorite movies of all time.

2785_7	"\Bend It Like Beckham\"" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes.
Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes.
Nothing wrong with this, however.
\""Bend It Like Beckham\"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end.
My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre).
Watch this movie and enjoy.<br /><br />Grade: B+"""
8869_7	"In this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot.
It is actually nice to watch because Singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships.
This makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for.
In fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap.
Definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie."
5972_8	"Nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? I really liked this movie because I remember when I first saw it in junior high.
For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd."
3669_10	"This movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing American patriot actor -- one that believes his work (and politics) are as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the President himself.
Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes, and I will immortally remember Bates as this character.
This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike.
It is a valuable piece of cinema, that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces.
Wonderfully, \Hollywood North\"" does not suffer from the subject that it portrays: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control, and commands both the serious 'behind-the-scenes' portion of the movie, and the movie-within-the-movie, \""Flight to Bogota\"" with clarity and insight.
If you are at all interested in the wit and strength of Canadian cinema, \""Hollywood North\"" is a great place to start."""
12233_8	"Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn.
His comrades are killed instantly, but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones.
Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer, melting every step of the way, he is tracked by his friend, Dr.
Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning).<br /><br />This is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional.
It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's, and as such, it's a marvelously entertaining movie.
That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious.
We're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything, but is still a gas to watch.<br /><br />Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed.
I think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long, but ultimately he delivers solid, schlocky, B-movie goods with a degree of panache.
The climax is especially fun.<br /><br />Arlon Obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments), and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times.
That brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects, which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie, right down to the ultimate final melt.<br /><br />Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough.
DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero, and Ann Sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge, and Lisle Wilson are fine in support.
It's also worth it to see folk like Cheryl \Rainbeaux\"" Smith (doing an appreciable topless shot), Janus Blythe (of Tobe Hoopers' \""Eaten Alive\"" and Wes Cravens' \""The Hills Have Eyes\""), and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part.<br /><br />This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore, chills, and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere.<br /><br />8/10"""

low budget standards! But the film was oddly addictive and i liked it, and i never fell asleep or turned it off, which is always a good sign!

3781_7	"I wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original, but it is very good in it's own right.
The comedy in this film is just as good as the original though, there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them.<br /><br />The story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great.
Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast.
The core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles.
I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter's Bill.
I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays the part of Ted Logan's father does a really good job.
The scene where Ted possesses his fathers body and Hal London Jr begins acting like Ted is a great scene, and he pulls it off impressively well.
I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the movie for me.
The rest of the cast is quite good as well.<br /><br />If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I would hope you would like this film as well.

8019_7	"\The Muppets Take Manhattan\"" is different in a lot of ways to every other Muppet Movie made so far.
For one, it remains the only Muppet film not owned by Disney.
As of 2008, the film still belongs to 20th Century Fox (CBS Fox at the time of its release) even though Disney owns the rights to the Muppets.
Also, this film has a story line that's very non-linear, and events that are otherwise unpredictable.<br /><br />Of course, it's very hard to beat the original \""Muppet Movie\"" from 1979, especially since that movie had more memorable songs than \""Manhattan\"" does.
However, one way in which \""The Muppets Take Manhattan\"" is better than \""The Muppet Movie\"" is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios.
In the first movie, all the Muppets really have to do is go to Hollywood, walk into an agent's office, and they are immediately given a \""Rich & Famous\"" contract.
In this movie, the Muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success, and it's a lot harder to do that, especially in the entertainment business, than they initially thought.
That's an important and often times overlooked message, provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the Muppets, being small and made of cloth, don't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively.
Above all, their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story.
Another note: The celebrity cameos in the movie were cool, and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the Muppets.
That ability right there is a testament to Henson, and how appealing the Muppet characters were even to adults.<br /><br />Where \""Manhattan\"" falls flat, and this is where I'm sure people will disagree with me, is with some of the key songs, especially in the end.
I thought the wedding song \""He'll Make Me Happy\"" was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding.
It sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral.
Every time I watch this movie, hearing that song makes me unusually depressed, especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as \""Together Again\"" and ends happily for that matter.
\""Saying Goodbye\"" was a sad number too, but it fit better into the movie because the Muppets were disbanding and weren't sure they were going to see each other again.
That last song was such a let down, and perhaps even added to younger viewers' misery of seeing their favorite Muppets leave the big screen.<br /><br />\""The Muppets Take Manhattan\"" is overall a good film, and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other Muppet films, including the newer ones made after the deaths of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt.
Fortunately, the film marches in the same direction as well.
I just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy.
Plus, Disney should have gotten its hands on this film's copyright and given it a proper DVD release.
Maybe it will someday.
We'll see."""

Boo, scary! Bush's frat bros invading the White House dressed as Arabs wielding rifles? Bush 'accidentally' executing someone? (No, wait.
He did sort of do that as gov.) This may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time, but must now be considered as brilliant, if spooky, prescience."

<br /><br />I have read the book, and for those overly-critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation, I don't know what else McGrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!).
And as far as Gwen Paltrow's accent is concerned, I must confess I wasn't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress!<br /><br />I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery.
That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside.
The film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success.
If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker, then perhaps you should rent something like \""Death Wish III!\""<br /><br />The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings.
McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story.<br /><br />This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist.
The story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching.<br /><br />I have seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite."""
6469_9	"This is a really great short from Hal Roach.
This is because of two main reasons: The littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well-written elements.<br /><br />As for the littlest of the Little Rascals, I honestly can't think of a cuter kid than Spanky at about age four.
Despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years, he was just precious here.
And, placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny, but once again high on the cute factor.<br /><br />After the older kids blackmail Spanky into doing this awful babysitting job, all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose.
The gags are pretty effective and well-done for the time--with an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where Spanky FINALLY gets control of the little ones being the most memorable.
I haven't seen these shorts in many decades and I am glad I gave this one a chance."

The viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself, though her predictions are rarely validated.<br /><br />Credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting.

919_8	"Having been a fan of 'Columbo', I was sorely disappointed in 'Corky Romano'.
While certainly a funny movie, Falk's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used.
After 'Corky Romano', I was honestly both surprised by and soured on Mr.
Peter Falk.
HOWEVER, having just seen 'Finding John Christmas' and its predecessor, 'A Town Without Christmas', for the first time within a week of each other, I have to say that 'Max', Peter's Falk's delightful character in both movies, is surely as memorable and lovable as 'Columbo'.
While parts of the movie are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out.
I too wish I had recorded both of these heartwarming Christmas movies, and I highly recommend them whether you're a Falk fan, a Christmas nut, or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week.
This movie may end up lost among the throngs of made-for-TV holiday flicks, so be sure to find 'Finding John Christmas' before it's too late."

729_10	"I seriously love this film so much, I never get sick of watching it.
The only line I really can't stomach in this is when Riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that, everything else is perfect.
I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the Ramones were until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her snarly little face for the most part.
Most people who watch this over and over are fans of the Ramones and really..
that's the only reason I love it so much.
I never get tired of seeing DeeDee mess up his Pizza lines or Joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over, haha.
One of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance , down the halls of the high school..
I love it.
The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly PJ Soles isn't on it.
Maybe she was working on another project *laugh* Anyway, great film, even better if you're a Ramones fan."
6158_10	"What can i say about a tale such as this? This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood,evoking warm memories in my heart.The characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene.
For example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore.
I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums.<br /><br />The story line was wonderful.I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr.Brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.<br /><br />I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other.
This movie is my definite favorite of all times.
I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time."

One of them catches his attention:Tisserand-José Garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade-.Then Tisserand will become some kind of prey:all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man.The scene is the night-club climaxes the strange relationship:the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he....
Well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak (Clouzot's misanthropy maybe)but just for a while.<br /><br />The form is weird beyond comment There are two voices-over,one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as \""our hero\"",one for the aforementioned hero.The story takes place,now in Paris,now in Rouen ,Guy de Maupassant's town.In a scene with his shrink ,the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for Man and he draws a parallel between his despair and Maupassant's one.

9916_7	"Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least \artful\"" objects imaginable.
Everyday items such as crates, boxes, metal containers, etc.
- items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by Burtynsky's camera.
He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them, that is.
Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynsky's lens (but didn't we already know that from \""Wall-E\""?).
He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e.
the workers in those places), with their uniform clothing and robotic movements, become part of the industrial landscape.<br /><br />\""Manufactured Landscapes,\"" a documentary about Burtynsky's work, has much of the feel of a \""Koyaanisqatsi\"" about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns.
Indeed, director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms, as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China, a dockyard in Bangladesh, and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China.
With their fluid camera-work, the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynsky's images.
In fact, the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows.<br /><br />The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the \""themes\"" of his work, which, quite frankly, come out sounding confused, contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best.
But it is as a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting image and form, that \""Manufactured Landscapes\"" resonates most.
In the case of Burtynsky, perhaps, a picture really IS worth a thousand words."""

There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although short.
Some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done.<br /><br />This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it.
The humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile.<br /><br />There is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids."
3467_7	"I still wonder why I watched this movie.
Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles.
I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is.
Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much.
Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up.
This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching.
Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very smart.
I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note.
My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone.
It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep.
Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup."
11177_8	"*****Spoilers herein*****<br /><br />What really scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?<br /><br />Maybe.
But those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child.
\Pet Sematary\"" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.<br /><br />I've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc.
I disagree.
The acting is actually first rate for a film like this.
Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario.
But the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible.
This is the true horror of \""Pet Sematary\"": It isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does.
Despite warning, or even past history.<br /><br />The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart.
The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect.
And the results are horrifying.
In fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it's almost a letdown, although I believe it's perfectly logical how it got there.<br /><br />I am a true horror fan, and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made.
If you don't think so, see it again after you have children."""

Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good.
Davis was so young and fresh.
She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect.
Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years.
My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was.
Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight..

3526_8	"Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /><br />Production: Universal Pictures<br /><br />Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), following a nasty fight and split with his wife, looks to drown his sorrows at the local watering hole.
There he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and, looking for some companionship, asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems.
She agrees, but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves.
Sure enough, when Scott gets home he finds the police there, waiting to question him.
His wife's been murdered.
Where were you at 8 o'clock this evening, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he doesn't know the woman's name.
And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman.
Neither does the cab driver.
Nor the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club.
Even the dancer at the club, who Scott clearly caught looking at the woman (they were both wearing the same hat), won't acknowledge there was someone with him.
Something is going on, but whatever it is Scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife's murder (on the flimsiest 'evidence' in Hollywood judicial history).
It's left to his loyal secretary, 'Kansas' (Ella Raines), who's later joined by a sympathetic Inspector Burgess, to find out the real killer before Scott is executed.<br /><br />Phantom Lady is built on themes that recur, almost compulsively, in Woolrich's work.
For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man.
Additionally, there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or spouse as found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black.
It can leave a viewer feeling like he's treading on well worn ground.
But in the right hands, the feverish plots, sorry dialogue, the narrative inconsistencies, all are beside the point.
Fortunately, Phantom Lady was being guided by sound hands.<br /><br />This is Siodmak's first noir.
He would go on to distinguish himself as one of the, if not the, preeminent practitioners of the style (The Killers, Criss Cross).
Here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer Woody Bredell (they would be reunited on Christmas Holiday and The Killers).
There is some great storytelling done in the camera.
In one shot, the deteriorating mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror, suggesting multiple personalities.
The same character, who is an artist, has Van Gogh's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment.
But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look for noir.
Released very early in 1944, it's all here; the wet pavement, the bags of atmosphere and dread, the sharply contrasting b&w, the wildly expressionistic versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), the discordant shafts of light, etc.
It is a terrific picture to look at.<br /><br />Franchot Tone aside, the cast, as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director (and presumably, the budget), suggests 'B' movie ambitions.
I thought Tone was a little hammy.
Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not up to much, and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes.
Ella Raines is mostly good (and quite beautiful).
Her 'sex scene' with Elisha Cook Jr.
is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed.
Another standout scene is when Kansas goes after the bartender to question him.
It amounts to a chase scene, as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets, with a stop at a subway station.
Some real good tension in there.<br /><br />*** out of 4"

3437_8	"Some genre films need to be dressed up.
This one was an exception.
Taken on its own merit, it's a dressed down version of the horror genre film.
With minimal special effects, it manages to be a psychological study of sorts, with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus, and why her? It's not a great film, yet because there is little contrived about it, the story works.
Subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters.
Actually, there is one contrivance in the opening scenes, but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what's to come.
I very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy, and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge.
You will enjoy the film if you have some empathy, value the need for a bit of adventure in your life, and wonder \What would I do in this situation?\"""""
11199_9	"I sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock's lesser known films, because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden Hitchcock gem or a true Hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc.
So, that being said, I would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc.<br /><br />Now, that may be overshooting a little bit, The Ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above, but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, 
I really think that The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them.
As an almost brand new director, there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.<br /><br />Granted, the film does start with, among other things, the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer (and I use idiot in the definitive manner, the way Stephen King so often does) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people.
I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then, but I think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any Hitchcock film I've seen.<br /><br />The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round, but when he meets his match, it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger.
So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman, who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.<br /><br />(spoilers) There is, for example, a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and, just before going into the building, she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss.
This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband, or at least ultimately chooses him, they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss.<br /><br />The film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years.
There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack's trainer who, in his stone faced expressionism, reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton.
Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous, but this is a great sample of his early work."
8021_7	"The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing, with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright (yet volatile) lights of Broadway filled with typically naïve optimism.
Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; so, the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them.
Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner (the old man, then, has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs!).
We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a confidence trickster), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit's, sporting fake moustache, as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets' show),
 Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (in possibly the film's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig!).
The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces, with (regrettably) less space given to Gonzo this time around; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny.
What disappoints, however, is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue) which, rather than the expected splashy routines, procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!"
6949_10	"\Addictive\"" is an adjective I've heard many times when talking of certain TV shows.
Most recently, dramas like Lost, Heroes and Prison Break have earned that description.
However, as compelling as they may be (and they really are) I can wait a few days before I see the next episode of either series, even Prison Break which some have lazily classified as \""the new 24\"".
With all due respect, there can be no such thing, and for a good reason: no other silver-screen thriller is based on a real-time structure.
That's what sets 24 apart from any other show, and that's why I practically have to watch an entire season (on DVD) in seven days or less: once the frickin' clock starts ticking, it's impossible to tune out.
<br /><br />An episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of NYPD Blue (and, more recently, Deadwood); having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours, one per ep (the actual running time is 41 minutes; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly),
 was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since Hill Street Blues introduced non-linear storytelling (a mandatory element nowadays).
And it truly paid off.<br /><br />Ironically enough, the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding (fortunately, creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller), which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere: looking extremely relaxed, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter Kimberly (Elisha Cuthbert) and, minutes later, being tender with Teri (Leslie Hope), the wife with whom he has just reconciled.
As in The Sopranos, though, something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner: not only has Kim snuck out of her room, Jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately.
At midnight? I'm afraid so: Bauer is a CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent, and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), an African-American Presidential candidate who will be in Los Angeles for the whole day (oh, right, I almost forgot: events occur on the day of the California Presidential Primary).
No time for napping, then: Jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case.
Unfortunately, he has a tendency to ignore protocol, and that doesn't sit well with George Mason (Xander Berkeley), a slimy man from Division who has been asked to interfere with the operation.<br /><br />The plot is very dense, making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span, but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly: the writing is sharp and precise, the attention to detail unsurpassed, and the suspense is consistently sky-high, mainly thanks to the real-time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level.
<br /><br />Another great quality of this pilot is the characterization: most genre shows (sci-fi and thriller) tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on (a textbook example is CSI, where character development is minimal, but then again that matches the show's unique style), whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people, among whom Jack (Sutherland's best role - ever!) and Palmer (the real revelation of the show) stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only (the former divided between job and family, reckless but humane, the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity).
A couple of supporting parts border on stereotype (Mason and Tony Almeida especially), but two factors ought to be taken into account: a) this is the first episode; b) there's so much going on most viewers won't even complain about a \""flaw\"" or two.
After all, how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy, a missing teenager AND a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season?<br /><br />Tick, tock, tick, tock..."""

Or watch the real object prompting Moe's exclamation, \Oh...highly polished mahogany!\""<br /><br />Emil Sitka is at his bewildered goofiest.
And the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny.
He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are \""regular\"" people in other shorts.<br /><br />For Shemp aficionados, this is a must have episode.
It won't disappoint."""
2005_10	"Almost too well done...
\John Carpenter's Vampires\"" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects.
And obviously aiming on the \""From Dusk Till Dawn\""-audience.
\""Vampires: Los Muertos\"" tries the same starting with a rock-star Jon Bon Jovi playing one of the main characters, but does that almost too well...
: I haven't seen Jon Bon Jovi in any other movie, so I am not able to compare his acting in \""Vampires: Los Muertos\"" to his other roles, but I was really suprised of his good performance.
After the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing \""It' my life\"" or something, but kill vampires, showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done.
This means a lot, because a part of the audience (also me) was probably thinking: \""...just because he's a rockstar...\"".
Of course Bon Jovi is not James Woods but to be honest: It could have been much worse, and in my opinion Bon Jovi did a very good performance.
The vampiress played by Arly Jover is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in Part 1 (or in similar way in \""Ghosts of Mars\"").
Jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy, moving as lithe as a cat, attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin, light almost transparent very erotic cloth.
And even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made.
It really takes some beating.
But the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like Murnau's \""Nosferatu\"".
You can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a VERY personal note and different to the original.
This is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point: The audience celebrating the fun-bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun-bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed.
Make no mistake: \""Vampires:Los Muertos\"" IS a fun-bloodbath but it's just not ALL THE TIME this kind of movie.
Just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce Zoey in the ruins: the bar-massacre is what you expect from american popcorn-entertainment, the seducing-Zoey-in-the-ruins-scene is ALMOST european-like cinema (the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between Zoey and the vampiress, but refuses answers at the same time.
Because it would had slow down the action? Showed the audience a vampiress with a human past, a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody).
And that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not.
And also: Is the \""From Dusk Till Dawn\""-audience really going to like this? I'm not sure about that.
Nevertheless Tommy Lee Wallace did really a great job, \""Vampires:Los Muertos\"" is surprisingly good.
But I also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie Wallace is sometimes almost too creative, too expressive.
Like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience.
In my opinion, Wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time.
\""Vampires: Los Muertos\"" is almost too well done.

4189_8	"Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie.
He is a professional pickpocket.
He's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four.
Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody.
Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark.<br /><br />This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely.
What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films.
This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film.<br /><br />The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater.
The sets show it is a limited budget film.
The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift.
Hoover wanted it changed.<br /><br />Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953.
The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year."
7739_10	"Ever read Jim Thompson? He's hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I've ever encountered.

This film has Thompson nailed - \If God made any real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it.\"" Every character in the film balances on a razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism.
There's sleazy, conniving Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and spookily well-intentioned Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson.
Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heart-wrenching performance as Kid Collins, a none-too-bright, shy ex-fighter who's more scared of himself than of anyone else.
Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale who we can't quite figure out...It's not your standard film noir, nor is it intended to be.

There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie.
Director Suo's tricks were subtle for the most part; I found his highlighting the character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making her sublime, a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that I was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters.

21_7	"This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.<br /><br />The story revolves around Iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley.
Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen.
Of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...<br /><br />Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband.
However, Robert DeNiro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect.
They aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.<br /><br />I won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character."

The story encompasses the struggling Garr, her two children and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household.
The \family\"" heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left Garr a run down, ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late 1940's.
The tenacious Garr, as the sweet but determined mom, gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe.
But wait......Aunt Zena is an old circus performer with card tricks, magic powders and a jesters sense of humor......she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games.....What happens next is a delightful combination of \""Miracle at Lords\"" thrown together with the Cuban missile crises (with authentic TV news from the real event) and a \""ghost\"" prank that gets totally out of hand.
This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of October 1962's Cuban missile crises.
In the end one is left with the wonder of faith, family and rediscovered love.

There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there.
If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about.

5840_7	"While the premise of the film is pretty lame (Ollie is diagnosed with \hornophobia\""), the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick.
It's also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one--probably since this was the last Hal Roach-produced Laurel and Hardy film.
In fact, it wouldn't be a bad idea not to see ANY of their latter films, as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos--something true Laurel and Hardy films NEVER would do.
They had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie work at a horn factory.
This sounds pretty funny, but it isn't.
Not surprisingly with all the racket, Ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work.
The doctor (James Finlayson--in his last film with the team) recommends an ocean voyage.
However, they don't like sailing and Stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock--then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother! Once they are on the boat, a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea.
Fortunately, this portion of the film actually was well-paced and the very end worked out very well.<br /><br />While not a great full-length Laurel and Hardy film, it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers (like in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND).
Additionally, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy--something you would see almost none of after this film.
Part of this was due to the boys' declining health (and Ollie's increasing girth) and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films."""

4308_8	"Before there was Crash, there was this interesting film called Grand Canyon.
Released about 14 years sooner than the former film, Grand Canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime.
To me Crash was still a slightly better film, but Grand Canyon was no slouch either.<br /><br />Taking place in Los Angeles, an upper-class lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time.
He calls for a tow truck, and has to wait for awhile, only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car.
Soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment, and out steps Simon (Danny Glover) to take the truck away.
Both men are threatened, but Simon manages to get himself, Mack, and the car out of dire straits.
It is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with Mack helping out Simon just as Simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier.
You see Simon's sister Deborah (Tina Lifford) is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children, and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people.
Mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking Simon up with his secretary's friend Jane (Alfre Woodard).<br /><br />This is the main plot of the film, but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above (Mary Louise Parker) as well as Mack's wife, (Mary McDonnel) who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son Roberto (Jeremy Sisto in his first movie role) has gone to camp for the summer, and will likely be moving on with his own life soon.
The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes.
This simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story.<br /><br />The director Lawrence Kasdan, whose biggest movie to this date was The Big Chill, has created a splendid movie here.
The cast is excellent, and most of the ideas are well thought out, but alas it falls short of greatness because some points, that would've made the film even stronger, are glossed over.
The story involving the secretary is one, and the second involving Simon's nephew is the other.
These scenes should've been more apart of the entire story, and then maybe Lawrence Kasdan's views of life between the upper and lower classes would've been more on a superior level instead of just very good.
Still Grand Canyon exceeded expectations, and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after.
There is also a small role for Steve Martin as Davis, a producer of violent films, who offers his own views on life, and has a small part to play in this movie's ideas."

We don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are.
It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they.

Movies like INVADERS FROM MARS made it all too clear to us \small fry\"" that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the Homeworld; THE BLOB just reiterated that fact.
I recall, fondly, late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society.
There was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran an Atomic Age classic every weekend.
These were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the \""color\"" print of THE BLOB had faded to a faint pink- but, man, was it fun.

9698_10	"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE.
This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals who secretly can talk.
Instead, it is about a Parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stammer, overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart-wrenching scene early on.
Then the great journey begins.
Paulie the Parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend, Marie.<br /><br />Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people.
He falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her.
He gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him.<br /><br />He recounts his tale to a sympathetic Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie.
<br /><br />Tony Shaloub shines as the kindly Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little Paulie despite the risks.
Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot AND one of the seedy characters he comes across.<br /><br />There is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too.

8222_9	"The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts.
It is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan (as played by Clint Eastwood) so popular.
He carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, Harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing.
But it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen.
And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `Sudden Impact,' directed by and starring Eastwood, so successful.
In this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: Whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.<br /><br />In his own inimitable way,
 Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time.
So he does; as only `Dirty Harry' can.
In a small town north of San Francisco, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O.
employed by the perpetrator.
Unaccountably, Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief, Jannings (Pat Hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere.
Not one to be deterred, however, Harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke).
Gradually, Harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?<br /><br />Eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `Dirty Harry.'
It had been seven years since the last `Harry' offering (`The Enforcer,' 1976), but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor.
And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4.
As with all the films he directs, Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end.
<br /><br />The screenplay, by Joseph Stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `Dirty Harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by Charles B.
Pierce and Earl E.
Smith) is the most engaging since the original `Dirty Harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action.
The characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of Harry's best catch-phrases: `Go, ahead-- make my day...'<br /><br />As Harry, Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: He lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today.
Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before.
No matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry, or at least have him around.
`Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, Eastwood `is' Dirty Harry, without question, just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.'
She manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre.
Even amid the violence, Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life.
Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood's Harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.<br /><br />In supporting roles, two performances stand out: Paul Drake, as Mick, creates the best `psycho' since Andy Robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `Dirty Harry.'
With actually very limited screen time, Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience.
This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end.
Also effective is Audrie J.
Neenan, who makes her character, Ray Parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city.
It's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell (Horace), Mark Kevloun (Bennett) and Nancy Parsons (Mrs.
Kruger).
With a perfect blend of drama and action, `Sudden Impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience.

3408_10	"I give this movie an A+ for the sheer camp of it! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in the book on her mother, \If one sees The Garden of Allah in the context of high camp, it can be very amusing.\"" And how! I laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue.
Viewers who've read the accounts of Boyer's toupee (it kept coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.<br /><br />Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance, presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good!).
Dietrich's costumes are out of this world.
As Riva notes in her book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns, such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.<br /><br />I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor.
It really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.<br /><br />In short, if you watch The Garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness, you can't help but enjoy it."""
4654_7	"It's about an embezzler, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, posing as a computer whiz and security expert.
He secretly learns to hack into the computer, while gathering the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of his office rival, Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith.<br /><br />Some of the business details were a little murky to these non-business-oriented eyes but they're believable enough and I got the general idea.
Ustinov, the peculating Peter, establishes phony businesses in Paris, Rome, and Stuttgart, and uses Texa-Conn's computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments.
The overseas companies, of course, consist of nothing more than himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are an abandoned artist's loft in Paris, a barber shop in Rome, and a bakery in Germany.
He simply visits them to collect the checks he's sent himself.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side.
I was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage, along the lines of \The Pink Panther\"" or \""The Lavender Hill Gang.\"" But this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot, the characterizations, and the dialog.<br /><br />Probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable.
<br /><br />Ustinov to Secretary Smith: \""Let me have the assets of these companies.\"" Smith: \""Assets? What are they?\"" Ustinov: \""Little female donkeys.\"" Now, nothing is made of this little exchange.
There's a quick cut and no delay for any laughter, which is appropriate because one's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh.<br /><br />Ustinov searches out that crummy loft in Paris.
It's covered with cobwebs.
Bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupant's paintings have been left behind.
The landlord doesn't speak English and Ustinov knows no French.
Ustinov points to a child-like painting of a nude woman and chuckles, \""Ah.
A fam fye-tal, eh?\"" Landlord chuckles too, replies: \""Vous le prenez pour une anee?\"" Ustinov: \""Oh -- ANNIE, so that's her name!\"" Landlord: \""Oui?\"" Ustinov: \""Entente cordiale!\"" (Mes amis, if I got those genders wrong, je m'excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) has the hots for Maggie Smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he's taking \""the scenic route.\"" There is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs.
\""Caution.\"" \""Lay-By.\"" \""Give Way.\"" \""Yield.\"" Ending with the imperious \""STOP/CHILDREN.\"" There's another montage when Ustinov's scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors -- blurry rooftops, police cars, a farewell embrace from Maggie, ending with a sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs.<br /><br />Well, maybe one more.
I still can't get over Malden as the boss, declaring decisively, \""I never agonize over decisions,\"" then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water.<br /><br />The acting is unarguably fine.
It's Bob Newhart's best role, for instance.
Not that he had that many, and not that his range wasn't limited, but he's perfect in this part.
The musical score by Laurie Johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it.
She seems to have written a brief concerto for flute.
Ustinov's passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini.
Stuttgart's phony president is somebody named Schmidt, and he's an anomalous clinker.
Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois, and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems.<br /><br />Delightful, in its own quiet way, but don't expect comic fireworks."""
3444_10	"I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it.
I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats.
Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film.
No Hollywood BS, no explosions, no corny one liners; film.
It drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate.
Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken.
They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone.
Michael Bay's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience.
No need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain.
We'll even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products.
And don't forget the explosions, we all love explosions.
Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways.
Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily.
Movie are entertainment.
Descent is a film.
Film is art.<br /><br />If you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus, this rape scene is every bit as powerful as \Irreversable\"".
The distinction here is that \""Irreversable\"" was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued.
\""Descent\"" is about date rape.
No less disgusting.
No less depraved.
Just different.
This is about trust violation, soul desecration and the scars that run deep.
Had the character \""Maya\"" been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene.
But seeing as she was desperate to escape, the scene is sickening.
\""Jared\"" is a sick and manipulative serial rapist, and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair.
How could \""Maya\"" ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her \""Jared's\"" slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined.<br /><br />The film as a whole is beautiful.
The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on \""Maya\"" and the silent inner workings of her mind.
All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture.
The soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything.
My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; \""Maya\"" dancing in a sea of writhing bodies, something inside her awakening, becoming aware, all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune.<br /><br />I don't think I've really spoiled anything here but I'm stopping before I do.
Bottom line, I think this was the best film of 2007, hands down.
Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered.
Death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you.
It's only the last thing that will happen in this existence.
The worst things that happen never leave you.
They are always in your thoughts.
When you shower; when you brush your teeth; when you buy a Christmas present, when you tie your shoe; they haunt you.
They haunt you until that last thing releases you.<br /><br />Treat yourself.
Challenge yourself.
Watch this film."""

12256_9	"Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this TV-adaptation of Jane Austen´s novel.
When I read that novel I was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: for honestly, she is so terribly self-righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously.
Kate Beckinsale´s interpretation, however, saves Emma from herself so to speak: she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and one can´t help but give in and like (not to say love) her in spite of her less amiable qualities.
Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this TV-series is so delightful; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr.
Frank Churchill, expressing this character´s personal magnetism to the full (which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by Ewan McGregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of Emma), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton, and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles.
This production is, in short, a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure."
3271_9	"I was always a big fan of this movie, first of all have you seen the cast, the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well.
Cybill Shepherd was given great reviews for her role, and they were well deserved.
The beginning of this movie starts in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly.
Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be \recycled\"" back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR).
Alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with hers.
But fate crosses Alexs path 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and embarrassing situations occur.) The music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute.

3423_7	"Do not expect a depiction of the \truth\"".
However, the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi & Afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration.
<br /><br />The major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives.
<br /><br />My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and Veterans Affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war.
These are NOT fatal flaws of the film.<br /><br />As a veteran myself, I know that the horrible aftermath of war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well.
These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing."""

Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying Frankie.
By being in the right place at the right time, Tony gets arrested with Frankie and is sent to jail...
where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship, but it will do for now.<br /><br />This film came to me under the title of \Frank and Tony\"", which is disappointing because I see an alternate name is \""Mean Frank and Crazy Tony\"", which would have helped sell the film more effectively.
I presume that's an homage to \""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry\"" but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film, \""Violent Professionals\"", and I must say the two complement each other very well.<br /><br />Italians have always lagged behind Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this film.
It is considered a \""grindhouse\"" film, which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie (or worse).
With a cleaner sound and picture, this could have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect.
I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) better than average and unlike \""Violent Professionals\"" the plot is fairly clear -- not too many secondary characters.<br /><br />If you like Mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try.
A film about the mob that's actually from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) is as much as you can ask.
Sure, it's not \""The Godfather\"", but it's not supposed to be.
This isn't a drama, it's a light comedy, heavy action buddy film...
like \""Die Hard With a Vengeance\"" from the point of view of the bad guys.
Well, okay, not really.<br /><br />If nothing else, this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast.

Rather Billy Elliot like I would say.

Good entertainment!"""
9065_10	"Watching the commercials for this movie, I was fairly convinced that I was going to loathe it.
For one thing, it was one of those \loosely based on the novel\"" movies, which usually means that the book author saw the script, hated it, and refused to be associated with the film.
Worse, the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable (ex: kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose...and falls over).
So when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the \""must see\"" film of the season (of course, he thought the same thing about \""Cars\"", \""Over the Hedge\"", \""The Ant Bully\"", \""Monster House\"", etc, etc), I was admittedly less than thrilled.<br /><br />But once at the theater, the film won me over for a variety of reasons.
First and foremost, the writers capture 'kid dialogue' better than just about any other children's film I've ever seen.
A prime example of this comes directly after the boys' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet.
The boys do a lame, over-exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them, which makes it realistic since all little kids think (mistakenly) that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors.
Then one of the boys asks, \""Why did he say, 'alley oop'?\"" Another boy responds, \""Maybe he's crazy!\"" and the entire group laughs uproariously.
Not an overly witty rejoinder, but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious.
As if to confirm it, my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on-screen; I could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation.<br /><br />Another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying, sibling relationships, the new kid in school, and peer pressure/conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special.
For example, the bully (Joe) isn't stereotypical; he's definitely bad but not pure evil, and just enough of his home-life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins.
There's also no \""cue the dramatic music\"" moment where Billy ('Worm Boy') realizes what a complete tool he's being to his younger brother Woody, and yet, by the end of the movie, some type of minor transformation has been made.
There's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other, and very little of it comes across as corny.<br /><br />The only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous McDonald's dance party in \""Mac and Me\"" would scoff at.
Why oh why was it put into the movie?? Did Austin Rogers (Adam) pull a Macaulay Culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills? The entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on \""The History Channel\"".<br /><br />Overall, though, this movie was excellent, and the length (about an hour and twenty minutes) was just about perfect.
One of the best, most realistic live action kid films you'll ever see if you're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like."""
667_8	"Although I've long been a fan of Peter Weir, I hadn't watched any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave.
And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise.<br /><br />Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another Aborigine.
For David's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence.
But David believes there's a mystery underneath the murder, linked to tribal rituals.
As his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too.<br /><br />To reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.
I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting.<br /><br />There are many elements that make this a fascinating movie: Chamberlain's acting, for instance; but also the performances by David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces David into tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide.
The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie.<br /><br />But there's also the way Weir suggests the supernatural in the movie.
David has dreams that warn him of the future.
Australia is undergoing awful weather, with storms, hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution.
But it's also related to the case David is defending.
How it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie.
Out of little events Weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.<br /><br />Charles Wain's score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo.
The photography is also quite good.
Russell Boyd, Weir's longtime DP who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mystery.<br /><br />I also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines, it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions, like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai.
This movie is too clever to be that simplistic.<br /><br />Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who don't mind some strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch."

3531_7	"Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir starring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone, and Alan Curtis.
And he does it, I might add, without a lot of help from his male actors, i.e., Curtis and Tone.
It's Raines all the way, a pretty, leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her \noir\"" counterparts.<br /><br />Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadows, and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre.
The shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles are all effective.
But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook, egged on by an excited Raines.
It's this scene that brings \""Phantom Lady\"" into new territory.<br /><br />Siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines, who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man.
Franchot Tone phoned this one in.
Alan Curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived.
And he never, except for a brief moment in prison, seemed to be in love with Raines.<br /><br />The amusing thing about many of these films is that, as World War II progressed, interest in psychiatry deepened.
But often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as \""Possessed,\"" \""Spellbound,\"" and \""The Greatest Show on Earth.\"" Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder, but he appears to be closer to a psychopath.
In actuality, as evidenced by his headaches, he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain.<br /><br />Phantom Lady doesn't have the greatest plot, but it's well worth watching."""
2709_8	"To finally see what many consider to be the greatest women-in-prison film of all time, I felt like I had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds.
Boy, it sure contained the elements I expected, and delivered so much more.
A constant I'm discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold, tolerance, and resolve(..not to mention sanity)being tested by their superiors.
While most of them were hired for the way they look naked, because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements, something else emerges, other attributes, such as attitude and guts, that I ultimately respond to.<br /><br />This, as you may know all too well, was Demme's debut for his mentor Roger Corman, and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings.
For instance, there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states(..there's a particular number featuring warden Barbara Steele where she reminded me of Alex de Large of A Clockwork Orange).<br /><br />The film has female prisoners planning a daring escape, tired of the crazed antics of their wheel-chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc, Randolph(Warren Miller).
Juanita Brown is Maggie, the tough, sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out.
She's the one all the girls fear to cross.
Erica Gavin is Jacqueline Wilson, the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop, unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with.
Roberta Collins is Belle, a serial kleptomaniac, best pals with Pandora(Ella Reid).
Belle becomes the obsession of Randolph who promises Superintendent McQueen(Steele)that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies.
Drugging her up, Randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her, whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms.
Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith is Lavelle, in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a Senator.
Lavelle receives work in Randolph's office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to Pandora.
Demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break-out, using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages, with gunfire erupting.<br /><br />I was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time Demme collaborator, cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison, cells and rooms, not an easy task.
The prison is appropriately crummy and the girls, despite being quite attractive, look the part of desperate inmates longing, yearning from the very pits of their souls, to escape such horrid entrapment.
Steele is superb as the warden, understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far, candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge.
Cale's bluesy score is incredibly depressing, while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun-and-games..I think Cale's score mirrors Demme's handling of the material.
Cale and Demme's partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad, isolating, oppressive place, while, almost simultaneously, showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast.
My favorite scene happens outside the prison, as two of our girls(..joining forces with a third)interrupt a bank robbery already in progress..the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob! As you might expect, you get naked women in showers, prisoner in solitary, a cat fight, shootouts, attempted escapes which go awry, and other exploitative elements(..such as a horrifying shock therapy session, not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of Belle).
Interesting enough, Demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension, understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making."
3930_9	"It's remarkable that for 'Young Mr.
Lincoln's' supporting players Ford cast lesser known, other-than-star actors.
This not only heightens his film's focus on the central character of Lincoln, but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man embroiled, as each one of us inexorably is, in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them.
It's not so much through Fonda's Lincoln's words and actions but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln's worldview, sense of place in society and polity, and of how the people responded to Mr.
Lincoln's words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding.<br /><br />Give this a try: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, next time you view 'Young Mr.
Lincoln' shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will, I expect, be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford.
I like to suspect that Ford's storytelling through the supporting characters' reactions to Fonda's Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in 'Doctor Zhivago', in which it's the supporting characters' reactions to Zhivago that actually tell about Zhivago."
10509_7	"I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book.
Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work.
What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this.
This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material.
Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker.
The characters are well-written, credible and consistent.
I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared.
The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous.
Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored.
It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer.
I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again.
There is brief language in this.
I recommend this to any fan of romance stories.

But knowing that there were only weeks left before the Code made movies innocuous and bland, Paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and leering went out of style.
Vanities is so horrifically anti-female that it's delicious.
As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are displayed with price tags that would insult a Bronx hooker.
They emerge from clams (nudge,nudge;wink,wink) in postures of absolute submission.
Minions of the law, so stupid they cannot find the door, get to look up their skirts and snicker.
Bare-breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (Could they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) while we listen to \Sweet Marijuana\"" and watch as blood falls on a chorines's breast.<br /><br />Sure, Carl Brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesn't seem to have a clue what he is saying.
But it's all worth it as Norma steals the show while no one is looking.<br /><br />Taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise.
Watch this with a charter member of NOW and prepare to justify the whole Hollywood machismo sch tick between body blows.<br /><br />Toby Wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake.

This movie was okay.
Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it.
Okay, so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny.
This guy's boss was good, too.
But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn.
These two should have had a lot more time on screen together.
They're chemistry was great.
The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy.<br /><br />Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians.
To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot away.

3216_8	"Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs), who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants.
Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise.
Director Paul W.S.
Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout.
Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto.
Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions.
Bang-up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins.
Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might.
David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing."
5498_7	This documentary has been aired on both RTE and BBC in the last number of months.
Having seen it twice now I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making.<br /><br />Initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
The Irish crew set off with those intentions.
What happens when they get to Venezuela is startling as they witness first hand the attempted overthrow by rebel factions (particularly the oil concerns in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government.
What we the audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of Chavez by distorting events that transpire as the coup heightens.<br /><br />It really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers.<br /><br />
10276_10	Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama.
All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film.
There isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad.
Mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor.
If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended? As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.
532_9	"Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny.
The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known \death romances\"" such as Ghost.
While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey.
The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all.
But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur.
With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level.
The wonderfully, determinedly romantic aspect of \""Stairway\"" is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal.
<br /><br />This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages."""
7661_10	"Scanners II: The New Order is just as good as David Cronenberg's classic Scanners, Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies.
The film captures the style of Scanners which is a good thing, it wouldn't be Scanners without a head explosion so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first.
Scanners II: The New Order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well.
The plot to Scanners II: The New Order is a new take on the series since it has the Scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge.<br /><br />Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's sci-fi classic Scanners and should be seen.

5700_8	"I've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on DVD.
To be honest I really don't know what the problem with it is.<br /><br />It's a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from various points of view, from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspects, including the late porn king, John Holmes.
Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot - I wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis.<br /><br />Many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but I really don't see it.
MANY modern movies were worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings (the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes, afterall).<br /><br />I was enthralled with both halves of the movie - the first showing John Holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict, and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath.
The movie has excellent acting, even though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality.<br /><br />The soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70's B-side rock and obscure pop, spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights."

Wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy! He looks dumb, but he isn't.
Ward is the slinky, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co- conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad.
Bruce Dern also is in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in about any film.<br /><br />The movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but I found it fascinating....and I don't like depressing movies normally.

1427_9	"I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series, \Planet Earth,\"" narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough.
Nevertheless, whether it was screened down here in Australia or not, I never caught up with it, and when I happened upon the opportunity to see 'Earth (2007)'  a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen, I jumped at the chance.
The theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though I had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet Earth.
For 90 minutes, I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness, amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film.
Awesome in its scope, and yet painfully intimate at times, 'Earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet, and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction.<br /><br />Though the film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness, 
it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda, and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether; indeed, there is not a human in sight.
Instead, we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world, to experience the resilience, and also the fragility, of life on Earth.
I hear that the original mini-series, which ran for eleven episodes, delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems, but I think that, here, the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact: I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired, and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time.
By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals, anthropomorphising them to an extent, we are suddenly able to appreciate the \""human side\"" of each species, and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy.<br /><br />'Earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to 
lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice, or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta.
The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death, most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions.
Though occasionally, perhaps to cater towards a younger audience, the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment, I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature, and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final, hopeless efforts at survival.
There's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt, both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey {the result of a single fateful misstep}, or the majestic mid-air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion.
It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.<br /><br />Aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes.
Of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly.
By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear, elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles, via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography, throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show, and only 90 minutes to show it.
Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for \""Planet Earth.\"" Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007."""
2883_9	"\Cinderella\"" is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried.
Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters.
One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife.
Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did.
Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared.
So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back.
While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper.
Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper.
The duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, Cinderella.<br /><br />Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950.
This film is about a magical fairytale.
In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her, but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love.<br /><br />My favorite thing about \""Cinderella\"" is the music.
When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo.
When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it.
I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love.
Overall this film was my favorite film when I was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life."""
3711_7	"\The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!\""  Robert Altman <br /><br />In 1955 Charles Laughton directed \""The Night of the Hunter\"", a spooky slice of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a scary serial killer.
One of the film's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from Mitchum on a rowboat, the kids frantically paddling whilst Mitchum wades after them like a monster.
<br /><br />Seven years later Mitchum played an equally spooky killer in \""Cape Fear\"", another film set in the American South.
That film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with Mitchum terrorising folks on a boat.
In 1991 Martin Scorsese, trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream, remade \""Cape Fear\"", boat scene and all.<br /><br />Now we have Robert Altman's \""The Gingerbread Man\"", another slice of small town Southern Gothic.
Altman says he consulted \""The Night of the Hunter\"" for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to \""spread his wings and try a popcorn picture\"", but what he's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the Southern Gothic genre.<br /><br />So instead of a showdown on small boat, we get a showdown on a giant ship.
Instead of two kids being kidnapped, we get two kids being safely returned to the police.
Instead of money being hidden, we have money being readily given via a last will and testament.
Instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh.
Instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys.
Instead of the monster breaking into the family's house boat, we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster's \""house ship\"".
Similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall.
etc etc etc.<br /><br />Altman goes on and on, reversing everything just a little slightly, pulling at the edges and doing his own thing.
His touch is most apparent during the film's first half-hour, the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot-driven movie storytelling and Altman's fondness for overlapping dialogue, casual narratives, prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what's going on.<br /><br />Still, despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity.
Altman's too bound to the conventions of the \""thriller format\"" to do much damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre.
\""Gingerbread Man\"" is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure Altman film and too Altman to work as a mainstream thriller.<br /><br />The film's not a complete waste, though.
Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the usually intolerable Daryl Hannah, all turn in juicy performances.
The film also has a nice atmosphere, set against a approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns.
While it's not the complete disaster that Scorsese's \""Cape Fear\"" was, the film still never amounts to anything special.<br /><br />7/10  In the late 90s Altman made 3 successive films set in the American South: \""Kansas City\"", \""Gingerbread Man\"" and \""Cookie's Fortune\"".
Unlike \""Gingerbread Man\"", both \""Kansas City\"" and \""Cookie's Fortune\"" tackle the genre on the broader, more looser canvases that Altman was most comfortable with.
<br /><br />\""Kansas City\"" is the more important of these two films, its hierarchies of class, politics and crime, and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks, would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers (see, for example, \""The Wire\"").
That said, \""Cookie's Fortune\"", while a much slighter tale, is perhaps the better picture.<br /><br />Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed \""Images\"", an art house thriller, in 1972.<br /><br />Worth one viewing."""
8955_8	"\Bell Book and Candle\"" was shown recently on cable.
Not having seen it for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy.
Based on the James Van Druten's Broadway hit, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash.
The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy.<br /><br />Evidently, judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb, the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars, who had collaborated on \""Vertigo\"", released the same year.
Movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released.
In fact, most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women.<br /><br />The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers.
Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing.
As the witch that becomes human, her Gillian is charming.
James Stewart, who plays the publisher Shep' Henderson, is also seen at his best.
Mr.
Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top.<br /><br />In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, playing Queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as she proves here.
Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd, the brother of Gillian, is also good.
Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch.<br /><br />This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching \""Bell Book and Candle\""."""

3404_8	"Audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length Technicolor film.
I can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one (3-strip).
At any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD.
In fact, just how good it looks is amazing.<br /><br />Kudos for that have to go out to Director Richard Boleslowski, Director Of Photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and, for the DVD - MGM Home Entertainment.
All of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age.<br /><br />I thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second.
It gave a nice message in the end, even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it.
I can't say more without spoiling things.<br /><br />Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I don't believe, and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character (\Domini Enfilden\"").
Heart-throb Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini's object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me.
People like Joseph Schildkraut as \""Batouch;\"" John Carradine as \""The Sand Diviner;\"" The most memorable, to me at least, was the dancer \""Irena,\"" played by Tilly Losch.
Wow, there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I've viewed.
Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD.
Looking at her IMDb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films.<br /><br />Basil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing \""Sherlock Holmes,\"" also is in here as is C.
Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day.
Schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, \""The Shop Around The Corner,\"" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.<br /><br />The beautiful direction, photography and color, and Tilly's dance, are the things I'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one.
Had the last half hour been better - although I admire the ending - I would have rated it even higher.
It's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection."""
6370_8	"To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment.
The Film had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to.
It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical.
I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan.
Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest.
Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.<br /><br />One disappointment was the animation.
With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little.
There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.<br /><br />"
4498_8	"Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green!! Wow, what a trio...OK, so this is no Anna Karenina, but it is a good love story, very well-written and well-acted by all.
Even a few 'laugh-out-loud' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity, age bias, and parental aging/Alzheimer's issues.<br /><br />Quirky guitar music added to the story as well.<br /><br />While I have been a fan of Ms.
Annis' since 'Lillie' (in the '70s) and Mr.
Kitchen's since 'The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I have only recently discovered Mr.
Green ('Me and Mrs.
Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), making me ask the question - why had I not seen 'Reckless' until recently??!! Admittedly more of a 'chick flick' than something a man will sit through, it is perfect for a rainy afternoon's lazy viewing."
1893_10	"Although it's most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, there's such a charm to Dudley Moore's portrayal of lovable lush, Arthur Bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character.
How can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness.
Although I'm not really a Liza Minnelli fan, she was really excellent as Linda Marolla and I couldn't picture anyone else in that role.
Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar.
The rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune \Arthur's Theme\"", wow.
Truly this was one of the Best Comedies of the 1980s.
Great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with \""Arthur.\"""""

6640_8	"This one-minute film is arguably the first movie ever made.
Other inventors had previously filmed actions - like Edison's motion photography of a sneeze - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium.
At the time, of course, their `cinematograph' must have bewildered their peers, including their subjects.
In this first instance, the brothers record employees leaving their factory, some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera.
The Lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle, but `La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere' doesn't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films.
The most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject.
Their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world's people, a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today.<br /><br />Rating: 8"
8858_10	"I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew, but I rented it basically because of the stars.
I certainly was not sorry.
In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars.
This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting.<br /><br />Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store.
The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family.
Through a series of flashbacks, we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons.<br /><br />Younger brother, Hank is basically a screw-up.
He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind.
Hank is insecure, cowardly, and very much under the influence of his big brother.
Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank \nailed to a T\"" and gives what is probably his best performance thus far.
He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task.<br /><br />Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit.
It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store, and he gets weak-willed Hank to commit the act.
Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays Andy.
Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath.
He is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or it might be said that he, through his superior acting skills, made Andy the perfect part.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation.
Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself.
He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish.
He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and Andy.
As we get to know Charles and Andy, the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable.<br /><br />On a personal note, I cannot believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself.
Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home.
Fortunately, my brother and I never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff.<br /><br />This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director, Sidney Lumet.
At eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes.
12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered.<br /><br />The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead are harsh and unattractive, and this is definitely not a feel-good movie.
However, it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which I thoroughly recommend."""
7842_10	"so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is crap.<br /><br />i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later.
maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.<br /><br />i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the OC.
can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm not very happy with fox right now.
even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED.
i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens.
a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless.
fox, film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace."
12068_9	"If you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film.
It probably was originally a play, and that's why it's dialogue heavy, but I can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters.<br /><br />This film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character-driven story.<br /><br />"
2269_10	"I have just recently read the novel \mother night\"", I've owned the dvd for some time now, and watch it every so often.
Few movies I own and have seen have made me think and question as much as Mother Night has, I am amazed at the brilliance not only of Vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to screen.<br /><br />Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on dvd, and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film.
To see how they took a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think any viewer will be amazed.<br /><br />The omissions in the movie are few from the text, and do not detract from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation I have ever seen.
I so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it.<br /><br />It will change you if you do."""

Anyway I managed to get him to watch it because I told him it was about sport, and you know what, he loved it!!!<br /><br />Drew Barrymore is very funny and her leading man (sorry but can't remember his name) is equally as good.
When I watched the film it was called 'The Perfect Match' but I think the title was changed for the UK as it is based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a film made about football with that title (the same film but the UK version - phew!),<br /><br />Anyway all of the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them buy girls, take it from me,

7156_10	"Holes is an awesome movie.
I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite films.
It's one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isn't cheesy.
Holes is generally a very cool motion picture.
I wish Disney would make more pictures like it.
Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool.
Don't get the wrong idea, I don't mean to bad mouth Disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and THAT'S OKAY.
Children deserve to have their entertainment too.
But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail.
But not with Holes.
It's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny.
Really, it's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to.<br /><br />Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge.
I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this."
971_8	"This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film, THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero.
However, due to far superior modern technology, puppets and CGI are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd.
However, give it a chance.
Don't think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film.<br /><br />In many ways, this is exactly the sort of advice I'd give to adults who watch Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and features tons of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits).
The big differences between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child-friendly.
While I do think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was intended mostly as a kids' movie, in the USA, most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent, scary and features some adult behaviors.
So who is the audience in the West? Well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and composition.
This is a rather narrow audience, indeed! <br /><br />While you are watching, look for all the strange little touches.
In fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time.
A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about Gamera, the scene that came with the comment \KIDS: Don't Try This At Home\"" as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)! 
<br /><br />By the way, director Takashi Miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories I've seen have seemed \""normal\"".
Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films I've ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS).
One thing for sure, it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other."""
3407_8	"Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film.
The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life.
Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous.
She look great; Boyer looks young and trim.<br /><br />Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the terrific score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting cast.
The film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide, C.
Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays....
well I'm not sure.
He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich.
I can't help but think he would have been wonderful.
The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well.
And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color.
She looks great and wears some terrific clothes.
My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.<br /><br />Certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars."
5912_7	"by Dane Youssef <br /><br />\Coonskin\"" is film, by the one and only Ralph Bakshi, is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern America (modern for the day, I mean--1975).
Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.<br /><br />But this is a Bakshi film, controversial, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone.
Not just another random \""shock-jock\"" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock.
It's by Ralph Bakshi.
Anyone who knows the name knows that if HE made a movie, he has something big to say...<br /><br />Although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation, \""Coonskin\"" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick.
\""Coonskin\"" wants to be more.
It aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre.
Nor does it just indict black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places.<br /><br />\""Coonskin\"" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break.
The fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the \""Coonskin\"" world alone makes it old-fashioned.<br /><br />One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary.
The Itallian mob is running all the real action.<br /><br />Big name black musicians star: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to take home the Pulitzer.
Something big is happening here obviously.<br /><br />The movie plays out like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide.
From an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.<br /><br />Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word \""sublety.\"" This one looks like it's never even heard of the word.
But maybe a subject like this needs extremism.
Real sledgehammer satire.
Some subjects can't be tackled gently.<br /><br />Bakshi is god-dammed merciless.
Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene appears unscathed.<br /><br />The characters here are \""animated\"" to \""real\"" all depending on what the mood and situation are.
The animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.<br /><br />Bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value.
He always has something to say.
Nor is black-face is gratuitously.
Here, unlike in Spike Lee's \""Bamboozled,\"" he seems to be using it to try and really say something.<br /><br />Like 99.9% of all of Bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live-action.
Usually at the same time.
Bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here.
All of this technique is all intertwined, meshing together while saying something.<br /><br />Somehow, this one feels inevitably dated.
Many of these types of films (Bakshi's included) are very topical, very spur of the moment.
They reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back of them years later, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).<br /><br />Even though the music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is.
Anyone who's really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in company of the people know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big ol' bear and a fox.
One of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these \""dirty n-----s\"" after the death of a cop.
But for him, it's not just business.
Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield.
It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.<br /><br />The sequence involving the Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many.
It plays out like an opera or a ballet.<br /><br />The promo line: WARNING: \""This film offends everybody!\"" This is not just hype.

After a break of seven years, Dirty Harry has finally gone back to his roots.

The good guys triumph over evil, without blood and gore to get the point across.
Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless.

5207_7	"If you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie, then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars? It's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera, they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name? Christian Viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard-gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars.
Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn Allen and Taylor Hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since Scream Reinvigorated the genre.<br /><br />Samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in October 2002 - thus keeping in check with the Halloween-based synopsis.
Unfortunately, the shoot was plagued by numerous problems, which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves.
Last I heard it had been signed by Film 2000 here in the UK and was penned for a late October release direct to DVD.
Unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with DTV slashers.
Not content with polluting our shelves with Camp Blood and its follow up, they were also responsible for unleashing Granny, Bleed and the rancid Paranoid.
Could Samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon? <br /><br />Five Canadian/American students and their teacher head to Southern Ireland as part of their history course.
Upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of Scotland and murdered locals for food.
The cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake, but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of Ireland to find refuge.
After the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre-fodder does in these flicks, the mandatory goody two-shoes (and definite heroine candidate) begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night.
Could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the Forest? Well what do you think? <br /><br />It looks as if Samhain's production was jinxed right from the start.
Almost immediately Wallmart refused to develop Jenna Jameson's nude make-up shots, and Chasey Lain began acting characteristically like a drugged-out primadonna.
Finally to add insult to injury, the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re-editing and removing all the gore.
Reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an R rating.
Veil of course disagreed, seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display.
Eventually after months of arguments, the director parted company with Warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults.<br /><br />Despite countless disruptions, Veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium.
The copy I was sent was the pre-release screener, which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack.
But still it boasted a few credible jump-scares, some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that I've seen for some time.
One guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine, Jenna Jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and Chasey Lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend (Richard Grieco).
Even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome, Samhain never feels mean spirited, which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichés.
In all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall, because the dialogue was not so much inspired by Wes Craven's Scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them.<br /><br />Certainly the inclusion of the mouth-watering Jenna Jameson was a great move by the producers.
Her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top (as expected) and so does Chasey Lain and Taylor Hayes.
But Samhain is no soft porn movie, and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce.
It's worth noting that the aforementioned XXX stars almost out-perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature, which isn't much of a complement.
Ginger Lynn was at least notable (if you ignore the shameful 'Oirish accent), and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by Alan Chou.
Taylor and Jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics, which could have been caused by the numerous problems on-set.
Veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much-needed injections of suspense.
Exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of Samhain.
Rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending, and I'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution.
If the end result is only half as good as the rough print that I watched, then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years.
This one is certainly worth checking out"

4197_8	"'Shock Corridor (1963)' was my first film from Samuel Fuller, and there I was impressed with the director's astute blending of B-movie and big-budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock.
'Pickup on South Street (1953)' was released a decade earlier in Fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio, Twentieth Century-Fox.
Nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike Dassin's 'The Night and the City (1950)' and Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets (1950)' {the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald}.
In some scenes, Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye.
Though (unexpectedly) prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti-Communist propaganda, 'Pickup on South Street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City.<br /><br />When just-out-of-prison pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) snags the purse of a woman on the subway (Jean Peters), he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for.
The woman, Candy, and her cowardly ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) had been smuggling top-secret information to the Communists, and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro-film.
Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder? If 'Pickup on South Street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti-Communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII {Dwight Taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'The Thin Man Goes Home (1944),' the only propagandistic movie of the series}.
For no apparent reason, every identifiable character  even the smugly self-serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self-sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset.
In traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean.<br /><br />Richard Widmark, an actor who I'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew.
The opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling Bresson's 'Pickpocket (1959).'
Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it (though, of course, she draws the line at Commies).
Jean Peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute.
Nevertheless, Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism.
Fascinatingly, upon its release, 'Pickup on South Street' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI, and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite.
Go figure."
6778_8	"A fondly-remembered melodrama  thanks chiefly to Ronald Colman's fine Oscar-winning central performance  about an oft-treated theme: the nature of acting and how it can overtake one's perception of reality.
In this case, we have a well-known thespian tackling Shakespeare's \Othello\"", so that the film's last third delves effectively into the thriller genre  with press agent Edmond O'Brien (who happens to really be besotted with Colman's co-star and ex-wife Signe Hasso) 'investigating' the actor's possible involvement in the Desdemona-like strangling of a celebrity-seeking waitress (a very slim Shelley Winters).
The theatrical/New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war era is vividly captured by the husband-and-wife screen writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and legendary \""actor's director\"" George Cukor (all of whom were recognized by the Academy with nominations); incidentally, the film nabbed a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score.
Colman, forever the suave leading man blessed besides with a velvety voice, does well enough by Shakespeare  gaining conviction the farther his character slips into obsessive jealousy, a murderous rage and, eventually, paranoia; however, he is not let down by a supporting cast which also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell.
Though the mid-section is a bit strained, the film makes up for any deficiencies with a remarkably-handled Expressionist denouement."""
10262_10	"Just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion.

7043_7	"Brand Hauser (John Cusack) is an assassin for the CIA.
He is ordered to go to the country of Turaquistan, a nation that the United States has \liberated\"", and kill a businessman named Omar Shariff.
This is because the American conglomerate, Tamerlane, that is putting the country \""back together\"" will not stand for Shariff, an oil man from a neighboring state, laying down his own pipeline through war-torn Turquistan.
But, once there, Brand runs into difficulties.
One, he meets a determined journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei) who wants to tell the American public the \""true\"" story of the region's conflict...and of Tamerlane.
But, Brand is aghast to realize that Natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission.
Also, his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop-singing princess, Yonica (Hillary Duff), who will be getting married at the convention center.
She is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn Brand's attention away from the coming assassination.
With other inept underlings and complications, will Brand be able to carry out his mission, for the satisfaction of Tamerlane's BIG boss, the former vice-president (Dan Ackroyd)? Good for you, John Cusack, to make this film, even though it doesn't quite hold together.
Shot in Serbia, it is a worthy look at what present-day Iraq must be like, a country turned upside-down.
In a stroke a brilliance, the green zone here is called \""The Emerald City\"" and aptly so, for this Oz-like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis.
The cast is very fine, with Cusack doing a nice job and Tomei, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Ackroyd and others backing him up in style.
Duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily-accented, heavily made-up, potty-mouthed singer.
The recreation of war-riddled Baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch.
As for the script, it isn't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes.
For example, a young Turaqui boy offers to show Brand an enemy hideout, in exchange for money and candy.
Brand produces the cash but, because he has no candy, the boy burns his vehicle anyway.
Brilliant! Then, also, the direction is not a total success but doesn't lag very often.
No, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit.
But, if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the \""war on terrorism\"", this is quite a good show.
Therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio \""formulas\""."""
3103_7	"\Perhaps we can arrange a meet.
\"" \""Where are you now? \"" \""I'm sitting in my office.
\"" \""I doubt that.
\"" \""Why would you doubt that? \"" \""If you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face.
\""<br /><br />Bourne remains street tough, and elusive.
Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy.
Conversation is macho, to the point with only shards of Bond type gallows humour.
Its all about the action.<br /><br />The feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well.
A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect.
There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.<br /><br />If the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much, enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going."""
3560_8	"Joseph L.
Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves that he is.
Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style.
Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can't sing too well.
He is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity.
Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit.
Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry.
All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny bit.
Still, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world.
All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have."
4555_9	"Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this endearing film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother.
Amazingly, he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can control.
An amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis.

856_7	"The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is alone worth the price of admission.
He plays a kind of \James Bond's psycho twin brother\"", separated at birth, no doubt.
As an intense hit-man, his character is very sexual but even better, very funny.
Add the kind-hearted, uber-likable American \""guy next door', Greg Kinnear, to set up contrast.
The myriad locations, vivid colors, and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment.
Hope Davis is well cast as the \""gem of a wife\"".
But the focus of the film is on the two fellows, a new \""Odd Couple\"", and that's the part that works very well.
Have a great (probably R-rated) laugh, and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper."""
4096_10	"Perhaps it's me and my perverted ways, or the fact that I tend to have a very sick mind, but I rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise, I enjoyed it.
<br /><br />Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured I was prepared for anything it would offer.
I was clearly deceived after seeing...well...everything, to cut a long story short.
I can see why it was banned, not only for such explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality.
<br /><br />Of course, as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, a personal favorite of mine, it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever-the-hell-that-thing-was-like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation.
Of course, the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods.
<br /><br />But that's not all.
Oh, there is so much more! <br /><br />Not only do we get to see interspecial sex, but there's also humping horses, the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not humping the bed to get her...er...satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals.
<br /><br />Creative and enjoyable, but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after I went to bed...I was 15.
Words of advice when watching this film: make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed.
It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn films like this one."
6549_8	"Taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team, how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience.
In my opinion, their mission was accomplished.
A must see for young children, pre-teens, teens, and their parents.
OK there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order, but parents with young children should sit tight, the movie moves on to better things.
I am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, not syrupy about it either.
Nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills.
A lot to like in here, laughs, doesn't take itself too seriously, a real mystery to solve (one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus, and likable characters.
Nancy Drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion."
1117_10	"If you ever have the chance to see Sandra Bernhard live in person, you better move on it sweetie.
I saw her last year in Los Angeles at the opening of her Everything Bad and Beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was in the first row, and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show.
She is now in New York with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner, \Without You I'm Nothing\"".
We have lost Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Nina Simone, but Sandra is still with us.
Patti Smith is missing in action, but not Sandra.
Barbara Streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but Sandra more than makes up for where Babs leaves off.
Okay, i want it known, Ms.
Bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more.
I really wanted to push this film because of its truth, honesty, humor, eclectic songs (ranging from Laura Nyro, Sylvester, Nina Simone, Prince), and a script that defines the decadence, joy, sadness, ups and downs of the 70's and 80's.
It is my opinion that many (and i mean, MANY) comics have lifted, okay outright stolen, so much from this show if not from Sandra herself.
I won't name names but come on, people, you and i know who they are.
See, the thing is, Bernhard plays by her own rules.
This movie shows, as does her live performances, that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business, as well as pushing forward.
Her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs (during the time of Miles Davis,Coltrane,Monk), 70's TV shows, intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from Judy Garland to Joan Jett.
Most comedians couldn't even touch where Sandra is coming from or going to.
So, here i was, a year ago, watching Sandra at the Silent Movie Theater, in total awe and joy.
I wanted to meet her after the show, give her something that meant something to me, that, hopefully would mean something to her.
But i listen to my copy of Giving Til it Hurts, and just thank her in a prayer, of sorts for making me laugh, making me think, making me FEEL.
You can't deny this lady's presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage.
She's still here, damn it, even after the release of Without You I'm Nothing, some 15 years ago.
And she looks great, by the way.
I know this firsthand, walking from the theater one audience member said to another, \""She is SO FUNNY..and she still looks incredible!!! If you can't experience her live yet, please see this movie.
As for me, I do hope that Sandra will see this.
You've meant a heck of a lot to me, gotten me through some tough crazy times.
If you can send me an email, please do.
If not, knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so, is enough for me.
Come on, people, give it up for the Lady!!!!"""
6001_7	"By no means a masterpiece, and far from Errol Flynn's best, Istanbul still has much going for it.
The locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography, bring us back to a time long since past.
Errol Flynn does show moments of his past glory, and is OK as Jim Brennan, a pilot who's past comes back to haunt him.
The picture is actually a remake of 1947's \Singapore\"", and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche' by today's standards.
Also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply \""going through the motions\"" in this picture.
Many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats, CASABLANCA.
While watching the film, I could see many of the similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take that for what it's worth.
In closing, if you are a fan of Flynn, or old fashioned love stories, you might want to give this film a look.
Otherwise, I'd recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of Hollywood's classics...."""
177_9	"This is a feel-good movie and nothing more.
And for that, it is great fun to watch.
Sure it skims over political issues.
But so what? I am sure she wasn't trying to make 'Good Night and Good Luck' here.
Let's not try to make it anything else but what it is...light fare.
<br /><br />And very enjoyable at that!<br /><br />Do we remember what 1984 was like? We've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not.
I tend to differ on this point.
Goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it.<br /><br />Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Seems Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes Her, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she is doing...she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie just knows herself really well, and she knows what she can do really well.
<br /><br />She has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently.
I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she's ever been in.
She has never tried to be anything else but who she is...and that's that bubbling, giggly, girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it...you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments.
If it even comes that late.<br /><br />I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovable, comic actress."
4257_10	"This movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great!<br /><br />It isn't an idealistic movie, I would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place.
The characters are very nice but have also some \dark\"" sides, what makes you believe that these are real persons.
Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can find happiness with \""fire and passion\"" as the main character Gigi would say."""
8328_10	"This movie had me smiling from beginning to end, partly at the humor, partly at Meg Ryan (this is the perfect character for her), and always because it's just one of the best feel-good movies I've seen.

5964_8	"Being a genre film fan, a child of the 80's AND a fan of hard rock music...this movie holds a special place in my heart.
It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack.
It certainly was THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time.
I didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) DVD release in 2002.
If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, Trick or Treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare.
You'll never look at your stereo the same way again.
Or should I say MP3 player?<br /><br />TRICK OR TREAT TRIVIA- Marc Price (Eddie) played geeky Skippy Handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'Family Ties.'
After a string of direct to video flops including, 'Little Devils''Killer Tomatoes eat France' and 'The Rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy.
Recently, he has been considering a TV comeback.<br /><br />Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer/ screenwriter.
He has written and produced several major films and TV series, including: 'Space: Above and Beyond''The X-Files''Final Destination''Jet Li's The One''Willard' and most recently 'Final Destination 3'.<br /><br />Tony Fields (Sammi) started his performing career as a dancer on the TV series 'Solid Gold'.
He appeared in several low budget films and TV shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish Sammi Curr in 'Trick or Treat'.
Sadly, Tony passed away on February 27th 1995 of AIDS related cancer.<br /><br />Doug Savant (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething Matt Fielding on the popular sitcom 'Melrose Place'.
Since then he has had a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and TV series as: 'The One''Godzilla''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' and the short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series 'Firefly'.
Currently he can be seen as Tom Scavo on the smash hit series 'Desperate Housewives'."

You're welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8."
9786_8	I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast.
Emma Lung is courageous and interesting.
The director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional.
A complex story with the changing between eras.
Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town.
I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive.
There have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking.
Depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow.
The film has a good look and the cinematography is also good.
8778_8	"James J.
Corbett, heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be Errol Flynn's favorite role.
Possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western.
He grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn't understand why people liked him in them.
It is an enjoyable film, but hardly does tell the real story of James J.
Corbett.<br /><br />As portrayed Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win.
He defeated John L.
Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown.
He was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him.
Of course that was not shown on the screen.
The character that Alexis Smith plays, the banker's daughter who falls for him, has no basis in reality.
Corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives.<br /><br />Also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy.
His father in a moment of depression, probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself.
The murder/suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that Alan Hale presided over.<br /><br />One thing though that I did like about Gentleman Jim.
Ward Bond got the career role of his life in playing John L.
Sullivan.
Director Raoul Walsh got a great performance out of Bond as the blustering, but lovable Sullivan.
Even given some of Sullivan's bad points that don't make it to the screen like rabid racism, Bond's portrayal is the quintessential John L.
and the best thing about Gentleman Jim.<br /><br />Speaking of racism, one thing that should have been told was the fact that Sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet Peter Jackson who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time.
I say probably because as a challenger Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw.
That fight more than any other created a demand for a Sullivan-Corbett title match.
Of course when Corbett was champion he refused to give Jackson a title shot.
Maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day.<br /><br />Gentleman Jim is not Jim Corbett's story, it is a movie of Errol Flynn playing at being James J.
Corbett.
But Corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved Flynn's portrayal of his life.
It's as he would have liked to have been remembered."

7113_8	"Being from the Philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s.
There are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station--which still does exist, as well as scenes from the Northeast part of the city.
Good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then.
The movie gets a bit \chatty\"" at times - causing the viewer to briefly lose interest...but the overall storyline is solid and very moving.
Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film \""Bright Victory\"", also with local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville.
The Army Hospital has since become a college campus.
Neither of these films are out on any format and I can't imagine why.

8810_9	"I first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct Trio Channel a few years ago, and recently watched it again--sans commercials--on Sundance.
I was impressed the first time, and found it even more engaging on second viewing.
Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect--Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb--but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success.
Best of show: Shohei Imamura's amazing final segment, which contemporary critics such as the thick-witted Mick LaSalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists', but now stands revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic; Samira Makhmalbaf's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of Afghanistan;
 and Idrissa Ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for Osama Bin Laden--a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the REAL Osama.
Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and though Sean Penn's character study seems out of place, it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film-making.
All in all, essential viewing, and a darn sight better than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center."
1973_8	"I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film.
That goes for critics as well.
Sure, if it gets positive reviews that's OK and a plus, but most films that get critical rave I hate.
I enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film.
It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character...that being Catherine Trammell.
Sharon Stone is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one.
Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1.
Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection.
Her one liners are great, much like in the first one.
Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops, \If you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the f**k out of here!\"" Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one.
I was captivated by her.
Her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, its worth the price just to see Stone's performance.
I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be.
And yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the ending!"""
1894_8	"I remember trying a few minutes of this film, I'm very surprised I didn't watch all of it, from director Steve Gordon, his only film directed before dying of heart failure.
Basically Arthur Bach (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Dudley Moore) is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want, a mansion, a butler Hobson (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Sir John Gielgud), and plenty of booze.
He is to inherit $750,000,000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), they woman he and the family have chosen, Susan (Jill Eikenberry).
But instead, Arthur finds himself falling for Queens waitress Linda Marolla (Golden Globe nominated Liza Minnelli), which of course is threatening the inheritance, and 3/4 of his family's fortune from father Stanford (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald).
After the death of Hobson, Arthur, on the day of the wedding, disobeys the family's wishes, but Aunt Martha still gives Arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love Linda.
Also starring Ted Ross as Bitterman, Barney Martin as Ralph Marolla, Anne De Salvo as Gloria - Hooker, Maurice Copeland as Uncle Peter Bach, Justine Johnston as Aunt Pearl Bach, Florence Tarlow as Mrs.
Nesbitt, Marcella Lowery as Harriet - Martha's Maid, John Bentley as Perry and Peter Evans as Preston Langley - Party Guest.
Moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire, Minnelli is likable as the woman he loves, and Gielgud of course makes a great Oscar winning impression as Moore's humorous humble sarcastic servant, a terrific screwball comedy.
It won the Oscar for Best Song for \Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\"" (it also won the Golden Globe) (it was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and it was nominated Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Burt Bacharach, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

Very good!"""
7468_10	"As the one-line summary says, two movies have left such a remark on me when I walked out of the theater.
The one was \Stir of Echoes\"" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was \""Vanilla Sky\"".<br /><br />Its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants...
Walking out of the cinema was a bit weird, like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything.
One of those movies that you become one with the guy, and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie.<br /><br />One thing is certain.
The actors are awesome, the sound track is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9+.<br /><br />Surely one of the best movies I ever saw, and the movie that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world."""
6681_10	"This movie deserved better It's great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gags, some in-stuff for the \Geeks\"" amongst us (And we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effectual.
Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone.
I never read the comics series before I saw the movie, but have since.
as good as they are, I still recommend MM the film.
(Although having the Flaming Carrot as a character would have been cool, too) Greg Kinnear is, well,...amazing as Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller except William H.
Macy My favorite line in the film? \""We've got a blind date with Destiny.
And it looks like she's ordered the lobster.\"" See this film.
BUY this film! It's only 5 bucks and some change at your local Wal-Mart.
You'll thank me.
Really you will.
Oh, and Ms.
Garafolo is in it.
THAT ALONE makes it watch-worthy"""
5096_7	"This is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the Rider Haggard story, with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with Russian soldiers seeking a \Stone of Power\"" buried along with the treasure of King Solomon.
It's very well shot, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of Africa, and very well acted.
Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help rescue her father.
Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not named in IMDb's listing) are also memorable.
For all that Hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it, this one is well told and, except that it's too long, I enjoyed it.
6/10."""
6648_7	"I just came back from the Late-night cinema and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience pondered though the real-life black & white images of the partition,the freedom movement,etc which was very much reminiscent of the lives' our forefathers faced! Amidst this backdrop,mind you,there was no tel/fax/internet in those times but for the very voice of 
Truth & Non-violence, the cinematography infused some spirit of stark reality of adversity amidst the strict Raj.<br /><br />Gandhi shown as a hardworking Attorney in South Africa,who stood for his basic ideologies and gave every degree of conviction to spread awareness of the same with humility and sainthood which to the uttered speech of general Smut was shown as a nice farewell on screen.It had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour & a veiled threat to the British raj in India!
There was a nice remark when he said we pray in silence to the British in India now that Gandhi,the politician is set for India(towards sainthood).<br /><br />The very backdrop of a big family with many kids needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it's spell on the unfortunate kid's psyche who was left alone to aspire for unrealistic ambitions.Little did Harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father.He tries to do away from mentor-ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbours in the streets of Gandhi's residence when Harilal vents out his frustration in open.This means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism ,with debt and dis-obedience fuelling his negative thoughts.He still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scenes and even Gandhi's humble expressions form Harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the Father,Gandhi.<br /><br />he couldn't digest the fact that Gandhi couldn't share his love with him as he expected & was driven to rebellion when he couldn't understand the equal-merit based delivery of scholarship money by his father to his cousin where he saw a failed opportunity to study for barrister in england.<br /><br />This had to take it's toll in him thrown to the streets as a beggar when the whole of India was celebrating the Indepedence!The life of a destitute never changes come what may but the manner in which the sad death of Kasturba & Gandhi himself is shown brings in an emotional silence.Finally the last turbulent thoughts of the dying Harilal is shown as a flashback to keep the audience gripping and wondering where did the father of the nation go wrong? was he clever enough to be mentally strong to lead an-one man army & use his brave soldier-son as a weapon to show to the British & rival forces that when it comes to the interest of the nation,nothing comes in between.Sadly though that to read a Mahatma's heart one has to live outside his family and see which the emotionally naive harilal couldn't see living inside....<br /><br />A pity that such naive harilal's are still ruining the efforts of many Mahatma-like fathers in many families in todays' life and have taken to drugs,alcoholism and God knows what thoughts!!Here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!Please Obey and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?"
6482_10	"I had just reached thirteen when I first saw this series and I am watching it again, on DVD, over thirty years later.
The pictures over the opening credits have never left me.
It has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it.
My parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the programme afterwards.
It gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks I got in our school's public exams!<br /><br />Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect.
I get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War.
I cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it.
Maybe an similar Cold War series could now be contemplated, although who could replace Sir Laurence is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />Buy it!"
8443_9	"My favourite police series of all time turns to a TV-film.
Does it work? Yes.
Gee runs for mayor and gets shot.
The Homicide \hall of fame\"" turns up.
Pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series.
A lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the TV-series but it amuses the fans too.
The last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up.
And a short appearance from my favourite coroner Juliana Cox.
This is a good film."""
8056_8	"This picture in 1935 walked away with all kinds of Ocars for Best Director, John Ford, Actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner.
Victor McLaglen,(Gypo Nolan), \Call Out the Marines\"",'42, gave an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking.
Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to America and a new way of living.
Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher),\""Guadalcanal Diary\"",'43, gave a great supporting role as the leader of the Irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group.
Gypo Nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a Judas.
Great film for 1935 and wonderful acting by McLaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the film."""
10689_8	"As usual, Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie.
But, this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the Russian woman!! Well done.
Even facial expressions were great! Language was perfect (even in Russian language) and Nicole did a splendid job!! Hey guys - you get what you pay for:)"
6895_10	I remember this movie from the 50s when I was in college.
It is one of the funniest satires of American Westerns that I have ever seen.
I'm only sorry that I have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or DVD.
It is a real treat.
4908_10	"I first saw Martin's Day when I was just 10 years old, at home, on The Movie Channel, and still remember the impact it made on my life.
It touched me as no other film had touched me, and I remember balling my eyes out.<br /><br />After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere else.
I would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film! I guess it was one of those more rare films that not many people knew about, because no one, and I mean no one, knew what I was talking about.
I searched and searched throughout the years, checking video stores shelves and scanning cable TV listings, but always came up short.
Finally, in 1996 I found out I could special order it, I did, and have probably watched it at least 50 times since--and it still makes me cry, every time.<br /><br />Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man who is in prison (but genuinely a good guy), who yearns to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as boy.
This was a special place, where he lived off nature, spent time with his dog, and was left alone to enjoy life.
Soon into the movie, he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake.<br /><br />It isn't long before the cops find him, and Steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off.
Soon Steckert and his hostage (the 2nd Martin) become best friends, and have many fun adventures together--from robbing a toy truck, to hi-jacking a train, all on the way to this special lake.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, Steckert has great flashbacks of him at the lake as a boy.<br /><br />I won't ruin the ending for you, but I will tell you, this movie is a must see.
It is the BEST movie I have EVER seen in my life! I am, without a doubt, the biggest fan of this movie EVER! I managed to find the song that the two Martin's are singing throughout the movie (\I'm going back, to where I come from...).
I'm even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and cottage where Martin's Day was filmed.
Crazy, I know--but that movie just means so much to me."""
3648_8	"\Pandora's Clock\"" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film.
This movie, which aired in two parts on NBC in its debut showing in 1996, is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease.
The U.S.
Government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster.
I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked \""Pandora's Clock\"".
It's one heck of a thrill ride.
Jane Leeves (TV's \""Frasier\""), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as the President) also star.<br /><br />*** (out of four)"""
6997_7	"One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day.
The story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle.
The story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on.
Eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense.
All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office.<br /><br />There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do.
Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant.
The journey it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming.<br /><br />A good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end.
I would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights."
