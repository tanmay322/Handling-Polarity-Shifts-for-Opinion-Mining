11146_4	"Well, no, not really.
Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for.
The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty.
The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem.
There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot.
All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime.
I'd even watch it again.
<br /><br />Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf."
4281_1	"This movie can be labeled as a study case.
It's not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and non-artistic lust for anything that might be termed as caco-imagery.
The author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills (\Moldavia is the most pauper region of Europe\"", \""I don't believe one iota in the birds flu\"", \""Romanian people steal because they are poor; Europeans steal because they are thieves\"") are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude - but he is sorely off-target! <br /><br />What Daneliuc doesn't know, is that it's not enough to pose as a righteous person - you also need a modicum of professionalism, talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product.
Fatefully, \""The Foreign Legion\"" shows as much acumen as a family video with Uncle Gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guests.
The script is chaotic and incoherent, randomly bustling together sundry half-subjects, in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story.
The direction is pathetically dilettante - the so-called \""director\"" is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise-en-scene, his shots are annoyingly awkward, and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence.
(Of course, any comment is forced to stop at this level; it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as \""cinematographic language\"", \""means of expression\"" or \""style\"").
The acting is positively \""Cântarea României\"" (\""Romania's Chant\"") level, with the exception of...
paradoxically, the soccer goal-keeper Necula Raducanu, who is very natural, and Nicodim Ungureanu.
Oana Piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness, but she is compromised by the amateurish directions given by Daneliuc.
<br /><br />The most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget, via C.N.C.
(the National Cinematography Council).
The fact that long-time-dead old dinosaurs like Daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable (in a market-driven economy, they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection).
But the corruption of the so-called \""jury\"" that squanders the country's money on such ridiculously scabrous non-art, non-cinema and non-culture belongs to the criminal field."""

A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss.
It was vulgar and distasteful I don't think Dr Seuss would have approved.
How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better.
I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on.
Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.

maybe after dropping a hit of acid, SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE could watch this and make some sense out of it.

Rather wan, uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy.
Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble.
Alda's smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend--how's that for a fantasy?).

3070_2	"Oh, dear lord....
They've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest.
<br /><br />The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski.
He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet.
Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We're not really sure.
<br /><br />We had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point.
That point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself vanishes.
He lives only to be free, and means no ill on anyone.
We saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops that were chasing him.
<br /><br />When he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity.
He died like he lived, running wide open.
<br /><br />In the remake Kowalski has a whole history (including a first name, even.) He's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy.
He is a devoted husband, and excited expectant father.
He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery, but they even leave THAT in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers.
They even gave the part of \super soul,\"" the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break."""
10259_1	"I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial.
The commercial was great, but it I found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the entire movie (about 4) and even some that weren't in the movie.
There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember.
It was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people.
I guess my world of innocence ended that day, when I found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies."
5621_4	"I'm an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film.
After watching it, however, I honestly believe that I could have made a better documentary myself.
Its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources (despite his being listed in the credits on IMDb I didn't see Richard Dawkins anywhere), it's edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects, and it doesn't make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial.
The narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering, almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment, ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someone's mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir (i.e.
me).
Though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of Jesus, the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the Christian school which the director attended as a child, an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this day.
<br /><br />Though TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of Christianity.
There's certainly a dearth of skeptically-minded religious documentaries on the market, and this film could have helped fill the void.
Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him.
It's too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he needn't subject an audience to his coping mechanism."

So naturally, the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway.

4366_4	"Way back when, the X-Files was an intelligent, thought-provoking show.
A big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas, tying the plot to the spooky side of real life.<br /><br />I was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired.
The show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on (\One Son\"" and \""Requiem\""), and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were far-fetched, implausible, or downright silly.
But I figured, hey, give it the benefit of a doubt, maybe they're bringing it back because they've got some great ideas lined up.<br /><br />\""Roadrunners\"" really was upsetting.
Following \""Patience\"", which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid, the episode sees a strange (alien?) parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods Christians.
Oh, and they think it's the second coming of Christ, but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes.
Seriously.
There's never *any* attempt to make sense of this, to explain what the slug is, why anything that's happening is happening, or anything.
Even in the show's early years - in fact, *especially* then - you could expect a little bit more depth, a bit of background, or if not that then the opposite - a bit of mystery, some uncertainty about what this was all about.
<br /><br />It's Scully that really kills it though.
You could put up with the silliness of the premise, but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch.
You feel like you're watching some godawful teen horror, except that it's a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she's spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of, being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety.
Oh, and by the way, Doggett, the new Mudler, isn't around.
Scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him.
He shows up at the end to save the day - I can't even remember why - but apart from that, he's not really in it.
Again: seriously.<br /><br />In short, it feels like either a generic script written for another show, or someone's pet movie project which they've been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing, long-running show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable.
It might've worked on a lesser show, where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less.
But The X-Files had a good thing going, and Scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic TV characters of the 90s.
Deciding that you're going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they must've done on Star Trek a good fifty or so times is pointless."""

None of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy.

11029_4	"Anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, must have seen a film or two by American International Pictures, a distributor that resembled 1980s giant Cannon Films.
Wherever movie-goers ventured, AIP would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like 'Voodoo Woman' and 'The Undead;' in the 60s were Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'The Glory Stompers;' and into the 70s, AIP churned out grindhouse-level trash like 'Cannibal Girls' and 'Sugar Hill.
'<br /><br />'Dillinger,' released in 1973, is one of the more 'highbrow' AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven, over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned.
On the whole, 'Dillinger' is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable.
Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, 'Dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director John Milius ('Magnum Force') but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.<br /><br />The 109-minute 'Dillinger' - epic for AIP's scope - follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis, played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson.
Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice.
At large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout, including expert bankrobber John Dillinger (Warren Oates), Pretty Boy Floyd (Steve Kanaly), and psychopath Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss).
Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking along Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pierpont (Geoffrey Lewis).
He also hooked up with Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a prostitute of French and Indian extraction.
While taking place over several months in 1933-4, 'Dillinger' is basically a chase film, with Purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J.
Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />'Dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis.
Milius keeps an honest Depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts.
The film is never boring, moving at a quick, if haphazard, pace.
The action scenes are Dillinger's strongpoint, edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort.
Thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film, not to mention pounds of explosives.
This film is certainly not for the squeamish, with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place.
The violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on American life.<br /><br />This film never transcends its exploitation status, however, because the needed writing just isn't there.
John Milius, somewhat overrated as a filmmaker, places way too much emphasis on action.
The action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967's 'Bonnie and Clyde.'
But we simply don't get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward.
Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling.
All too often, the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.<br /><br />Aside from this, the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact.
While many say that 'Dillinger' is just a film, it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent.
Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as Milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe.
In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow.
While these inaccuracies might make for high drama, there is no reason why Milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.<br /><br />Warren Oates's performance as Dillinger is quite good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing.
Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the American press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime.
Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis, suave but rather flat.
Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it's really too bad that Milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with Dillinger.
We never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger.
The supporting roles with Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis, and a briefly-appearing Cloris Leachman, are acceptable for such talent.<br /><br />As a piece of 1970s exploitation, 'Dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins, which is exactly where I picked up MGM's DVD release for $4.99.
The film is nicely presented in widescreen (a must for drive-in flicks) with subtitles in French and Spanish.
Dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra.
Largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts, the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material.
For fans of the genre, it's certainly worth checking out.<br /><br />** out of 4<br /><br />Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr"
5110_3	"I occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes.
I try to enjoy it for it's basic idea which is helping a needy family, but several factors get in the way for me.
Every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted (which they are) and tears flow seemingly on cue.
The attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me.
The fact that everyone who donates something to the house, be it Sears or whoever, has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying.
Probably the biggest problem I have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family.
Now I know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for Disney/ABC but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house? Instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights? Isn't life difficult enough for the average person? Why do I need help finding things to feel sad about, why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative? I know what is being done for these families is good, but they are also being used for ratings.
You can't tell me they aren't being coached sometimes on the crying.
I guess when I see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the U.S.
could not afford for their children it really bothers me.
I can't help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of Disney's money.
Instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen TV and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food, clothes, education and medical insurance? I know so we can be entertained and have a good cry.
In terms of money, I feel the same about Oprah.
I don't think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses.
Yes her recent reality show did good things, but when she gave $30,000 to each losing \contestant\"" I'm sitting here thinking...that's a years salary for many, many people...if they're lucky.

11200_4	"The good fellas at Webster's Dictionary define Logophobia as the fear of words'.
I may just be Logophobic.
For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film, credits contain the words `Produced, Written and Directed by:', and are followed by a single individual's name.
Think about it.
There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jack-of-all-trades.
Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films.
But there I was, all nestled in my theatre seat, popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball, were the words `Produced, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland'.
Whoa! <br /><br />Being a film buff, I knew of Brian Helgeland.
As a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company's stock price in 1998.
There were as many theatrical unpleasantries (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory) as there were critical and award winning successes (L.A.
Confidential, Mystic River).
They seemed to alternate  one good, one bad, so knowing that his last film, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I took a breath and hoped for the best.
In retrospect, I should not have exhaled.
<br /><br />The Order stars Heath Ledger (Helgeland's A Knights Tale), as Alex Bernier, a priest in an order known as the Carolingians, who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the Arch Bishop deems curious'.
Meeting up with Father Thomas (also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings' Mark Addy), they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest's untimely death.<br /><br />Complicating matters is a sub plot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism.
Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience, they travel to Rome together.<br /><br />Nary a good nights sleep goes by and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno Fürmann) who claims to be a centuries old Sin Eater.
A Sin Eater, as we are told, are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not, thus allowing entrance into Heaven.
William, as luck would have it, is tired of a life of healing and looks for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties.
Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save her and the transformation is complete.
Alex then searches for answers to his many queries while Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator.
<br /><br />The Order is not a terrible film, but it is terribly boring.
There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters.
Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex walking in on the dying Mara - is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple's plight.
Everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film.<br /><br />So, Mr.
Helgeland, I plead with you not to try this again.
Share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self-serving.
Until then, there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade.

Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise .
I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner .
Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop .
As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter .
So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film .
Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy"""
11148_4	"This is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line.
Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong (having seen her work on the O.C.
I know she can do better), then find a better script and budget.<br /><br />The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly computer generated, that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on-screen.
And Samaire Armstrong's (alert!)changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad GCIF figure before she even begins to change(Final Fantasy's humans, as well as Pixar's made these laughable, think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll).<br /><br />The story of was interesting, though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new.
As it also got into the balance between evil, (maybe) not so evil, and the possible end of human-kind should the two lines mate.
The subplot of a \book of werewolf linage\"" which effected some of the other characters in a spell-like manner for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past.

5055_4	"Two years ago at Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth's directing debut-Haiku Tunnel.
So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob's, The Best Thief in the World.
This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower-class area of New York.
The movie is not without its poignant moments.
But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious: Life can be very difficult for some people.
And life isn't fair.<br /><br />More subtle, and more important, is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti-social behavior they may spawn, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity.
We can recoil at their language and their living conditions, but we are cannot discount their intent.
And in fact, their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate.
Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the people is evident throughout.<br /><br />Having said all this, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws (including the title).
The characters aren't very believable.
The writing is uneven.
And the plot-line is barely discernible.
And for many the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes.
To each his own: But while I don't question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it pains me to see 5-year-old children mf'ing and talking about having sex with a line-up of women.
It's unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest."
2538_4	"Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr.
Moto films.
However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had \jumped the shark\"", so to speak.
This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula.
For example, with \""The Brady Bunch\"" they introduced the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and with \""Family Ties\"" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! With the Moto films, they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled.
In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler.
And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears.
Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you kept hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! Although he's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip.
Again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon \""act\"".
It's so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot.<br /><br />As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene.
Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen.
In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.<br /><br />Overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here.
With WWII approaching, the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the US or in allied countries."""

However, it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale.

How does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle?<br /><br />The formula requires the cute female lead a la Ryan or Aniston--check; there's a built-in TV audience!<br /><br />Add thick-headed, compliant men, usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fiancée--check.
<br /><br />Assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars.
So far, so good.<br /><br />What is the male lead to consist of? He has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience (and the gay flight stewards) instantly swoon.
But...he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience, and he can't outshine the star.
Roll cameras...<br /><br />The problem is Messing thinks she's still in a sitcom...she has only one presentation: as the wide-eyed doormat that she's made a career out of.
A capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene, where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds.
<br /><br />You can't help feeling good for Mulroney...you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this.

I was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over-all score.Sorry, but to rate this highly as many have, is a joke! Once you get past the one shot/black and white movie gimmick, which was a nice idea, the movie drags on, even at a run time of only 66 minutes.
The credits sequence at the start was so annoying too!In the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel, wow, that was needed in the story!

Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester.
We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror.
There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music, CGI, or acting.<br /><br />The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy.
Even David Lynch's work feels like that at times, and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long.
And sadly this is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />The cast was attractive, and that is about the limit to this.
I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have, but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates...whatever they were.
The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous."
11260_4	"This movie should be called \plan 9 from joseph smith.\"" i think its weirdness is underappreciated.
the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich's \""the population bomb (1968),\"" and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons.
the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of \""heavenly father's\"" (god's) plan.
and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad.
get it?<br /><br />This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing.
it's utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the play was actually written in 1973, and of course, the theology is part 1840's, part battlestar galactica.
some of the action takes place on earth and some in the \""pre-existence, an aimless romper-room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries, losing their shot at celestial glory.
<br /><br />it is as stagey as they come, but don't let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the 'cool kids' are all into population control, (presumably) counseling their parents not to have any more children!! having big families was, at the time the play was written, the cultural norm in the lds community, and more importantly, considered part of God's plan.
the church has since done a 180, and have made family planning a choice of the parents, and large families are much less the cultural norm now.
making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern-day mormon moot!<br /><br />ahhh but it's really only as good as the music.
there are some catchy tunes here that just won't let this movie die the 1970's death it was pre-destined for.
the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there --wink.
and the tough, cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica.
so cheers to all that! gather the family around, make some jell-o shooters and enjoy the show!<br /><br />"""
3406_4	"Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the Challenger accident, deserves such luck.
The \stars\"" make a mockery of acting, Lea Thomson actually being turned sideways, when asked for more than her usual wide-eyed innocent smile, presumably to mask her risible attempts.
The movie is at times hilarious, when it begins to ask far too much of you.
A small boy keeps a multi-million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm-mates.
This hackneyed and unlovable machine, \""Jinx\"", is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie, which seems part Short Circuit, part 2001 by the Airplane team.
I shan't bore you with this, suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it.
Having said all of this, it is enjoyable to watch, in a SeaQuest, Saved by the Bell kind of way.
The romance and technology, beware, are as unbelievable as each other.
Also, if you're an eighties freak, its unmissable for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie from Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Lea Thompson.
Also, Joaquin Phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe Goonie who befriends Jinx.

Some people in the cast tries to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks.

BUT THEN! The rest of the time the film just repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again.
No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on and on.

6589_4	"I'm afraid that I didn't like this movie very much.
Apart from a few saving graces, it's nothing to write home about.
<br /><br />J-horror has boomed for the last five-six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success.
This is one of them.
<br /><br />Basically this is a supernatural slasher movie.
The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but soon after opens them.
However, after that, it's quickly downhill for this flick.
<br /><br />To be kind I will start with the things I like about \Gawi\"".
On the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type.
For those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed (no pun intended) murder scenes.
We also get a few good suspense sequences/set-pieces.
<br /><br />However, there are quite a few drawbacks also...
<br /><br />First of all, and my major complaint about this movie, is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity.
Usually that's not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are, I was confused on more than one occasion.
<br /><br />The performances are okay I guess (a little hard to tell when you don't know the language), but seem a little stiff.
And for a horror movie, I don't think it was scary enough.
For a while I was quite bored actually.
<br /><br />Being a fan of giallo movies, I was expecting quite a lot from \""Nightmare\"", but unfortunately I was quite disappointed."""
6750_1	"When you put this DVD into your player and hit \play,\"" you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc.
CHERISH THIS MOMENT.
Make sure you have some Tylenol or something (preferably PM's so you can fall asleep), because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts.
<br /><br />Starring a bunch of big-breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit, I thought I'd be in for a good time.
Sure, the opening sequence was a WEE bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a Scream ripoff (by the way, my sole chuckle was from Julie Strain's final comment in this scene).
But then I knew there was trouble...
the opening sequence had a terrible rock song.
During this terrible rock song, I looked over the DVD Chapter titles and saw things that said \""TOPLESS IN THE BACKYARD!\"" and \""BETTER THAN SEX!\"".
I knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be.
<br /><br />And that's the sad truth: The ONLY good thing about this movie is the attractive cast.
Other than that, it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an \""innovative\"" concept about murder clubs, which ends up being fake anyway.
So, the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery, but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters.
I mean, when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman, can you really feel ANY sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life? The Scream influence is prevalent throughout, with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes.
We're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad (Lloyd Kaufman! The only other cool part of the movie!) about an abortion or something.
Uh.
Yeah...
This isn't a \""so-bad-it's-good\"" movie, it's just BAD.

you know, most any film that comes from Full Moon (or its offshoot, as this film proves) is horrible.

Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: In Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams after the line \Tommy doesn't know what day it is...\"", they showed almost *no* Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We're Not Gonna Take It (Listening to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's blazing guitar chords.
Huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band.
It's a very frustrating film to watch, and doesn't deliver the goods.
I don't know if director Murry Lerner is just not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a Who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him.
To its credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, that are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant.

1058_1	"No Fireworks Despite Violent Action.
<br /><br />Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter.
With essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found.
Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility.
The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.

Although based on the original Paramount screenplay, there's over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what's left imminently forgettable.
With rare exception, the younger generation wasn't interested in watching old black and white movies on TV back in 1973 (still true today, alas) so this lurid, compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers; then as now, ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre.

In addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube, Lee J.
Cobb was able to hold my interest as a world-weary, tired-looking Keyes but Richard Crenna's affable and inoffensive Walter Neff only reminded me of Bill Bixby on a bad day.
Improvement upon the original was, of course, never intended in a rush to make a buck but, instead of a mindless retread, a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea.
Cain's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer.
The completist in me is thankful this speeded up \""Me Decade\"" update was included as part of the DOUBLE INDEMNITY DVD extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original, it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better-made COLUMBO TV series.
I also flashed back to a very good 1973 ABC TV Movie Of The Week that I haven't seen since its initial airing: John D.
Macdonald's LINDA starring the beautiful Stella Stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's (sexy John Saxon) wife and then frames her mild-mannered husband for the crime and, if I remember correctly, there's also an open-ended ending.
Like DOUBLE INDEMNITY, it was needlessly remade with TV movie queen Virginia Madsen as the titular vixen and Richard Thomas as the milquetoast husband."""
12116_1	"I'm a Don Johnson fan, but this is undoubtedly the WORST movie, done by anybody, that I've ever seen.
The acting was bad, as was the cinematography.
Don should stick to doing action, because as The King, he just didn't cut it."
4418_1	"This is a film that takes some digesting.
On the one hand, we are offered a tough outward shell, a story that does not only derive the Catholic Church, but does so foolishly, and uninformed.
On an inner layer, we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis, and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand.<br /><br />At first glance, it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy.
If so, then Mr.
Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word.
The jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered.
In particular, Ms.
Keaton's performance is flighty and over the top, well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days.
Jennifer Tilly is again the model of stridence, with her hi-pitched voice and whining style.
All of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the last 20 minutes of this movie, that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981.
<br /><br />***Careful, spoilers ahead***<br /><br />It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact, just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with.
) When they all admit that they don't live up to the church's teachings, the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny, all-too-cliché sepia-tone flashbacks.
When one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive, until the pupil pulls out a gun.
After wrestling it away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in self-defense.
She then goes on a screaming rampage, killing a gay former student because of his sins.
The last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a Christ-like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her.
Can you say `heavy handed?' I knew you could!<br /><br />I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result, but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie.
I have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously, no pun intended.
This explanation is hard to swallow, though, simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another.
This film is simply anti-Catholic tripe, which in the name of fairness and equality, is mean spirited and hateful.<br /><br />This is a film I would recommend for a catholic, namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today.
If it were `Rabbi Ray explains it all' or `Imam Muhammad explains it all', there would be rioting in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription.
But, sadly, because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view.<br /><br />I certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic, so it wasn't just ignorance that brought them to make this film.
<br /><br />I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and just a bad movie in general.
Don't even waste your time."
12347_1	"This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film.
Ridley Scott is a wonderful director.
But this film is a black mark on his career.
Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army.
Very stupid.
And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way.
It is really not difficult to make a film such as this.
Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody.
The writers didn't have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all; and some brainless action.
I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish.
I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess."
2421_3	"with this ABC family attempt of the hit blockbuster \cheaper by the dozen\"" comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue, shallow plot lines, and cheesy comebacks.
With about two good actors among many wanna-be's, this movie was a major disappointment.
Its a Hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already bad plot.
Then, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant that they'd probably be more lenient.
So the acting wasn't five-star.
The plot moved fairly fast, and the twists were bad and had horrible timing.
The junction of characters and the \""end relationships\"" were also too mushy and clichéd for me.

I don't know at what point you do something about it.
There is a wife and child out there somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear.
But there should have been some times when he could have acted.
The movie seems to be somebody's joke.
I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders, we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two.
Nevertheless, why would someone make a film like this? What appeals does it have except for sadism.

7246_4	"Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely great in this movie, but the story is, unfortunately, half-baked, and David Schwimmer's energy is sort of like cold mush.

Who thought 25-year-old kiddies would be entertaining?"
2340_2	"The story is about the life of common people from Antwerp, living their lives.
So I said it, and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story.

So let's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next Deus-Barman picture."
6688_3	"This movie is pretty awful but I have some interesting information about it:<br /><br />It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ.
A good bulk of the extras in the film are then-drama students from NAU.
I was a freshman there that year, minoring in theatre, but for some reason I didn't get involved with the production.
I did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact:<br /><br />There is a scene in this movie where two of the principals, as part of their hazing ritual, have to run naked into the woods.
They are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that.
The thing is, those aren't the actors at all but two guys I knew from the theatre department.
The identity of these \stunt posteriors\"" will remain anonymous, at least to this website, unless they decide to, um, \""reveal\"" themselves!"""

1641_1	"This film is not funny.
It is not entertaining.
It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation.
Added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory.
It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like.
This movie is boring, obnoxiously mind-numbing, and at times offensive and disgusting.
At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh.
Also, it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time."
2995_3	Only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch.
A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.
The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place.
Mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge.
Now for the bizarre bit.
The little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation.
I think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-files history!

Now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week-end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends.

4568_2	"Not an altogether bad start for the program -- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement.
The worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but.
Men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this.
What is next, medical school in a minute? Charo performing lipo? Charles Grodin assisting on a hip replacement? C'mon...show a little respect.
Even the citizens of Muncie are outing the program as staged.
Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times can they use the car-to-car shot of the Taco Bell in the background?), cheesy siren effects (the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call' whether rolling code or not), and last, but not least -- more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at.

It has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine,if i was the director i would cut that part for sure, gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie...
For some people it will be boring cause it lacks action, feels home made sometimes...
Take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what? nop,not crying...their telling horror stories to each other..*sighs*(just after crying for hes lost
)<br /><br />Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like \hundreds\"" of candles in the table in front of them...the boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtains(old rags covering the windows) and sofas/Couches ...i thought it was dumb, using candles but not thinking about the surroundings, besides being in high sea alone...
<br /><br />The good, some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some.
Sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of, so this movie does it good, maybe because its a low budget i don't know, but it works fine for me! You will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones i mentioned above.

2313_4	"Shintarô Katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi.
The Zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept--a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers.
He's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive (I've actually seen every movie).
It is because of this I saw this final installment of the Hanzo the Razor series, as I assumed it would be very similar....and boy was I wrong! It turns out that the Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of \women who deserve it\"".
You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his \""penis of steel\"".
How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for the squeamish.<br /><br />Overall, I just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films.
However, from looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular...and that is pretty scary.
Despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes, the films just are like brain pollution--and I'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women."""
7672_1	"Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them.
Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones.
The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien.
The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began.
Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is.
If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film.
The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this.
If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store.
If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you."
3735_4	"Actress Patty Duke wrote an insightful, funny, rough-hewn book about her career as an actress, her crazy-quilt love-life, and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good.
With this rich material to draw from (and Patty playing herself in the final act), one would think a crack TV-director like Gilbert Cates could bring it all together on film, but \Call Me Anna\"" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography.
For those who haven't read the book, the sketchy narrative (leaping forward in time) isn't absorbing, we are never allowed to get our bearings with what's happening, and the production seems stunted by a low budget.
The actors are miscast, and the value of having Duke herself finally appear does not pay off--the film's phony reality is so thick at this point that Patty can't bring stability to the scenario.
It appears as if the producers were sincere enough (and consciousness-minded) to anxiously steer the film towards Duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom, but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process."""
3969_1	"I'm writing this because I somehow felt being led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie.
Whilst it's not the worst I've seen, it certainly isn't good.<br /><br />A Weak script, weak actors, and weak directing.
Even if they can't afford big name cast, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? It was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance.
The story was a cliché and poorly scripted.
The special effects were minimal.
The \suspense\"" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.<br /><br />To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors' episodes.
But not quite on par with quality movies yet.
Dark Remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's a poorly made one.
As for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy."""

I disliked this movie.
To be more specific, I disliked the concept of this movie.
The cinematography was good.
The mood was nice.
And the acting was satisfactory.<br /><br /> However, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading.
It is also offensive.<br /><br />I am a quarter Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitaker's character.
First of all, he's a black guy.
And this isn't a racist remark, I swear.
The thought of a White, Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents.
The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai.
For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway? It must be one of those replicas, which insults the Samurai caste even more.<br /><br />Also, Ghost Dog showed no honor.
Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain.
Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates none-the-less.<br /><br />Then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie.
You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable? He kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.
<br /><br />Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to: Bushido.<br /><br />So, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushi(samurai) holds dear.

8633_4	"I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of his Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I've come to expect from the great Italian director.
The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, or gory like the majority of his cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film isn't very good.
The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown.
This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that isn't exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage, there aren't many people that are sad to see him go.
This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death, and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter.
<br /><br />The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is \in the style of HP Lovecraft\"", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've ever seen.
There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better.
The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good.
Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying.
The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members.
This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame.
There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this isn't the Fulci we all know and love.
Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci's talents.
Not worth bothering with, unless you're a Fulci completist."""
12326_1	"A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (Eric Brown).
They have sex...but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something.<br /><br />Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever.
Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? I suppose it's OK cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage.
Sorry, but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it.
It's still sick.
I realize Brown was of age (he was actually 18 when this was made) but he LOOKS 15.
I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK.<br /><br />Plot aside the acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful--but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst child actors I've ever seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic.

I was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass for 18).

My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! Let me make this clear--three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity! That should give you an idea of how bad this is.

The film is rape/beating and revenge genre.
Couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes.
He didn't go to their car, instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped.Then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him...
So stupid scenario! Bellow Hollywood ! He was against that revenge but \She is raped\"" \""They laugh to her\"" so she must kill them all...
But once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle's top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy.
Personally I think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang-rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money.
LoL This movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won't see anything they are looking for...
This director should be banned...It is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by British cinematography which I personally like and that is the reason I've watched this.
Don't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film ..."""
3374_1	"This film is regarded by some as a classic - I've no idea why.
It is terrible to the point of being laughable.
The only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.<br /><br />There are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever.
My brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said I wouldn't believe how bad a film can get! He was right.<br /><br />Normally with a film this dreadful I would recommend that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case I think people should, as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective."
7546_1	"I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this.
I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is.
<br /><br />I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this.
The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic.
This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does.
<br /><br />So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans.
You could probably for it show up on television."
11845_1	"...is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power.
Kirsten Dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies like she thinks she's in \Legally Blonde.\"" The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him.
Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except that he's playing Charlie Chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for the part? Hard to believe this hamfisted, uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but then again, he hasn't made a watchable movie in, what? 30 years? Sometimes, there's just no coming back."""
618_2	"Perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films I ever did see.
I'll start with the bad points of t he movie, which pretty much covers the entire film.
First of all, something no one can avoid: TERRIBLE ACTING.
I swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked.
Secondly, BAD/UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK/DEVELOPMENT.
You hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here.
All you figure is that they deserved it one way or another.
The scarecrow's character was overdone, and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killers such as Freddy or Pinhead.
Next: BAD DIALOG: The Scarecrow was full of horrid one-liners that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible.
Lines like \Let's go find some small animals to torture!\"" really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised.
Last but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING.
How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? The back of his head was balding for God's sake.
There is much more I could say about this film, like it's cheap special effects, it's \""high school film class\"" effort, but the point is understood.
It's just bad film making at it's worst.
As for what I found to be \""good\"" in the movie: -Entertaining for those with low, low, LOW standards -Would help put insomniacs to sleep.
-A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle."""
11103_2	"OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year...
I thought that it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible...
First of all, we never get to know anything about the creatures, why they appeared, wtf are they doing in our world, and really, have they been on Earth before we were or did they just come from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created...
Really, how large could the underground for a sub station could have been? There were only so many of those creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just planted some tactical bombs, or maybe clear the are and a Nuke would have done the job.
I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see the killing of people as being NECESSARY...
Thirdly, Leon acts like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was way taller and bigger in stature.
Then again, when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp, watching all the abominations.
I mean OK, the conductor had creepy help(lol), but if Leon was so brave he would have gone all the way...
I mean he risks his life first, then does nothing exactly when he should have.
He could have died as a hero but lives as a coward...
this might be the case, but not after showing so much braveness earlier on...
Then, the cop thing...
come on! This was a city having a subway, I bet there must have been other cops except that lady, other police stations,this was really kind of silly...
All in all, great acting by Vinnie Jones, interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all...
By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones cannot make up for the rest..."
12024_2	"Quite the most boring nonsense I have seen in a long time.
The plot was full of irrelevance, and the acting was the worst I have seen in a long time.
<br /><br />To make it worse, camera angles that made me feel sick were used , the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing then), and the shots of San Francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board's promotional video.
<br /><br />Oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done.
Better lighting next time, please."
1560_2	"This film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly, just painfully mediocre.
Lacking any real wit or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the `jokes' (which are predictable and threadbare) are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer.
Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what `shocked' or amused us 30 years ago doesn't work quite the same way now.
We've seen it all before, and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated.
A major miss."

3302_3	"Swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate American hardened action movies like \Heat\"" but with a low budget.
This movie follows the same prescription as \""Noll Tolerans\"" and \""Livvakterna\"".
However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie.<br /><br />The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor, especially from the main actress.
The movie tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military-like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational.
It does not succeed very well.<br /><br />The bluish-cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore, and it is not even done well in this picture.
Only a very few scenes actually look good.
Also, the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward.<br /><br />The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, though not making a convincing portrait of a SWAT-team leader, has some really funny lines.
Also, the music is quite well."""
7977_1	"Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie.
The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay.
But, although I was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (I am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end.
Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I don't know.
It just is and so it is not recommendable."
5296_1	"I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really lame.
Even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...meh).
Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters).
There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere.<br /><br />The acting is among the worst I have ever seen.
I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch.
Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate.
Here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically.
And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending.<br /><br />(Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception.
She is by no means wooden.
Not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.)<br /><br />Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.<br /><br />And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel!
<br /><br />It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way.
I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it."
3666_3	"This is one very confusing movie.
The film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense.
The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant.
Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film.
The dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well.
The scenes are choppy, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more.
What I did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks.
Now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense, they might have had something.
Don't waste your time on this one."
2347_1	"First, let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why I was curious to check out this, her debut role.
No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent.
I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story.
However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.<br /><br />By the halfway point, I found myself thinking, \How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?\"" It seemed to go on forever!
<br /><br />Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event.
No such luck.
The movie continues it's bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.<br /><br />I'm not saying this because I'm an action-junkie.
I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedies.
But I expect to be entertained.<br /><br />Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies.
Depressing!<br /><br />I just don't get how anyone could like this movie.
Zero-entertainment value.
The longest 114 minutes of my life.<br /><br />"""
4365_1	Ariauna Albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery.
What could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom.
The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner Lilith Stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician.
This was a production that cried out for some T & A & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things.
However Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation.
The Tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & T & A.
Nough said.
8889_4	"This is the first of \The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare\"" BBC series I've seen, and if all of them are like this, I might watch no more.
Being practically the full text of the play is everything this \""Romeo & Juliet\"" has going for it, lacking in all other departments.
Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and artistic aspects.
In the former, because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid.
Take in consideration, for example, the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Balthasar in the opening scene, or the Nurse's entering of Friar Lawrence's cell, asking where's Romeo with him being so very in front of her that she'd clearly see him even if she was blind.
And, in the latter, because every single one of the performers is misdirected, even if some of them are good actors.
Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I've always imagined Juliet to look like, and she doesn't seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind.
Patrick Ryecart as Romeo is even worse, being not only as dull as Juliet, but also way too old and not even good-looking, coming across as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and the Chucky doll.
Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written.
Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings.
This Tybalt is so mean-looking that we don't believe the characters' pity after his demise.
As for Paris, I kept thinking of \""Prince Valium\"" from Spaceballs.
Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.<br /><br />At 168 minutes, this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters, because the characters don't empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles.
The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirelli's.
But, to be fair, this BBC one isn't nearly as bad as abominations like George Cukor's flamboyant geriatric version, or the crime against Humanity that is Baz Luhrmann's feature-length MTV video.
4/10."""
1665_3	"It was a decent movie, I actually kind of enjoyed it.
But the ending is so abrupt!! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends.
What happens after the concert? What happens with her boyfriend? Does she hook up with Grant? Does she come beck in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts.
There is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying.
I don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really makes the movie a joke.
I was very disappointed."

The final episode was everything against the previous seven years.
It has ruined everything.

let say, seven years only.
Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey.
Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them.
As the say, \journey is more important than the destination\"".

I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) Bush jokes.

Aside from the Cheney-Chicken-Eating joke, and some giggly-little swipes, it was really boring and unfunny.<br /><br />The animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year old's Flash Project.
It's disgraceful that they used Macromedia's product for this, because it's capable of so much more.<br /><br />I don't like Bush that much, and I enjoy a Bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this was just a half-hour swipe at the President with several painfully un-funny moments.

As I said he's not bad, he's just just miscast for what his back story is.
The real problem here is the combination of the script, which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness.
There is no life in the way things are set up.
Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list.
It makes for an un-engaging film.
And yet the film occasionally springs to life, such as the in the final show down that ends the film.

5416_4	"This was director von Stroheim's third effort - it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH.
Essentially we have a trio of grifters, masquerading as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo.
Their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune.
Part of that plan is for the Count (von Stroheim) to insinuate himself between a visiting American ambassador and his \foolish\"" wife, wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses.
He makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid, whom he has promised to marry.
When she sees them together, she sets fire to the room, (von Stroheim and his prey are on the room's balcony).
Here von Stroheim first establishes his persona as \""the man you love to hate.\"" He is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end.
The film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director.
There is a cute bit- when he first attempts to meet the Ambassador's wife, she is reading a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim.
This was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film, cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes.

In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do, unlike the original superman.
With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least believable manner.

I didn't care about any of the characters, but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap: I'd complain about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining \Live Free or Die Hard,\"" which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of \""Captivity\"" for 40 minutes."""
10228_3	"To be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it, but i'm never one to let others influence my viewings, in fact i'm more likely to watch something out of defiance!.
Bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away.
The picture isn't very good, and is in fact very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture.
Sadly it doesn't, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film, nobody in the cast come out with any credit, with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme.<br /><br />Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10"
1960_1	"I tried to finish this film three times, but it's god awful.
Case in point: mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast,mom stops for gas, crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the B&B try to rape her.
She escapes, heads to B&B and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops, story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts.
Wow.<br /><br />Other action logic deficits abound.
Acting is also lukewarm, and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny, badly acted moment.<br /><br />Moments of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interplay between characters.<br /><br />Less focus on gore, more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated."
11015_1	"I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago, and said to myself, \Seems funny, plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!\"" I proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it.
I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted.
Wooden performances abound.
All the \""hilarious\"" and \""outstanding\"" performances promised never seemed to arrive.
After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back.
I literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered \""comedy\"" I didn't want to believe in movies anymore.
My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was.
Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone.
This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I just became angry.
I began to yell at the movie, and I'm not one to talk to movies period.
Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen.
My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even.
The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding.
The fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity."""

9595_1	"In the recent movement to bring Asian films over to America, this is THE LAST movie that should be released here.
Being a big fan of asian movies from all genres, I was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re-released into the US market so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store.
<br /><br />Trust me...the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this movie out of the water.
Jet Li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences.
If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better off with a Jackie Chan flick!!!
<br /><br />Moreover...you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death BUT SURPRISE!!! A good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue, an absense of action, the lack of devloping a tangent plot, pretty much NOTHING to do with the premise we are exposed to.
It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer/director dedicated no time in elbaorating, and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue.
Would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect.
<br /><br />Speaking of which, I really don't believe the choreographer of Iron Monkey, did the action sequence in Princess Blade.
I was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness.
I just didn't buy it.<br /><br />Please...I'm warning you to PLEASE do not waste your time/money with this movie.
The premise is intrigueing, and the trailer might even tempt you but I am positive that this movie is NOT suited for the public (maybe in Japan but not in the states) and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the Asian film industry."
935_4	"Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with.
Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.<br /><br />From the first, BU is just a chase film.
We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another.
And another.
And another.
And another.
Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.
<br /><br />If you haven't see the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost.
If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.
<br /><br />Paul Greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character.
He runs.
He jumps.
He punches.
He gets blown up.
He clears tall buildings.
Yada yada yada.
Above all - he SURVIVES.
He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension.
So he drives off a building? So what? He'll survive.
Yawn.<br /><br />There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor.
I've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.
<br /><br />Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie.
He was turned into a killing machine.
Big deal.
He finds out his true identity.
So what? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.<br /><br />The 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak.
Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better end now before the slide continues.
<br /><br />I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller.
The Bourne Ultimatum is neither.
It's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence.
<br /><br />The idea that it 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is utter crap.
Casino Royale blows it out of the water."

She has stunning green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene.

She may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers.<br /><br />The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it.
It is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or remotely well done.
There is no skill apparent in it's production.

11622_1	"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love.
\Wanders\"" is probably not the word.
I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend.
He recalls to the day when the relationship ended.
The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions.
He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went.
I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being \""turned off\"" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him.
Did I mention how creepy Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person.
He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either.
It's just weird.
Too make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her.
He does so.
Which was really creepy.
He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her.
He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he \""drops in\"" on her.
He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend.
We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value.

The writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done, with a few scenes you can't hardly take.

5525_4	"The problem with family dramas is that, outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people don't want to watch them.
And the ones that do get watched tend to be sensationalized and about current or topical problems or issues in the news (or recent news).
Movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular.
Particularly with the young crowd that would be Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios.<br /><br />The specific problems I had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations.
It was a bit much to blame all of the Lohan's character's acting-out (wrecking the car, drug use, etc.) on what her step-father did to her.
While not improbable,it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow.
Additionally, other aspects, such as her giving the young Morman boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie along.
It placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their \special dramatic episodes\"" then it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film.
<br /><br />When you watch the DVD and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternate endings, you can really see all of this is sharp focus."""
8106_1	"Seriously, Why do American and Frech actors pretending to be Czechs need to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I am a man, so i enjoyed the gratuitous nudity--but a soft porn flick would have more of that, and at least wouldn't pretend it's artistic.

The characters were very shallow, and I just couldn't identify with them at all.
<br /><br />The bit where I did laugh was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footage-just ludicrous.
<br /><br />I read many of Kundera's short stories (not The Unbearable Lightness of Being), and there are good things about his style of writing (although his themes are one big male fantasy)-and I have to say, the film did NOT convey any of the goodness of Kunderas style."

\Slaughterhouse Rock\"" is by far the worst horror film that I have ever seen, a title previously held by \""Urban Legends: Final Cut\"".
From its opening scene I could tell it's going to be really bad, but I was so bored that I couldn't care less.
This film contains laughable acting, especially by the guy who's tormented in his dreams, incredible as in not credible plot twists, and some of the crappiest music I've heard, and I'm living in a period when the likes of Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the air waves.
The biggest problem with \""Slaughterhouse Rock\"" is that it's not funny.
One would a film as dull and boring and so NOT scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one-liners here and there, but no.
We have Tormented Guy's self-centered friend trying to be funny, but came across as annoying instead.

6377_1	"This is easily the most disappointing, least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre, which, by the way, are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home.
Rather than being \exploitation\"" or demeaning, these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era.
Well, not Bucktown.<br /><br />In this story, Duke returns to Bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother.
He quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force, bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses.
Duke resists, and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police.
Unfortunately, he does so by calling in a posse of his friends (these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with Duke on \""jobs\"" in the past) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood.
And literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it.
Ignorance is not a justification for murder, and it would have been much more entertaining to see the Cracker Police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street.
While revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre, it is a far cry from seeing Pam Grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family, cuss them out, give them a jujitsu ass-kickin' and set their 'fro on fire.
That has art (and a reason for existing) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back.
Of course, in this bizarre tale, she is playing a woman completely under The Man's thumb, afraid of the Crackers who run her town and oppress her people.
Indeed, her advice to Duke is, \""Run, man, they gonna kill you!\""<br /><br />Following the sickening and gratuitous violence, we are expected to believe that the town's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of Duke and his friends, congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor, as opposed to, say, calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody.
Duke's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree.
They immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their Cracker Police predecessors (to quote the mayor, \""They are ten times worse than what we had before!\"").
Now Duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of Bucktown from corrupt, protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets.
Unfortunately, Duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero, as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force.
I wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued Bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point.
I suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way Duke has to outsmart the new Police Goons, but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence, Duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the Cracker Police.
Duke is a pig.<br /><br />Finally, when everyone in town but Duke, Aretha, and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin' in the street, our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they don't.
Duke is merely a murderous thug and Aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice.
If you are interested in this genre of film, by all means, I highly recommend them, see Coffy, Foxy Brown, Truck Turner, Blacula, Sheba Babybut if in the process you should run across this DVD, throw it as far away as you possibly can! Drop it like it's hot! It should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste!

The curse gathers in that place of death.
Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury.\"" That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing.
Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further.
Those who encounter the \""curse\"" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get.
You want more? Well too bad.
Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you.
The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far.
Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over.
It pretty much unfolds like this:<br /><br />-person walks into house<br /><br />-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard <br /><br />-person goes to investigate<br /><br />-sound starts to get loud<br /><br />-person sees a ghost<br /><br />-loud scream and/or cat screech<br /><br />-cut to black<br /><br />Before the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour.
The first time was actually somewhat creepy.
Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on.
By the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end \""with a loud scream and a cut to black.\"" We were never proved wrong.<br /><br />The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled.
I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right.
The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason.
I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2.
And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had.
If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?<br /><br />Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $15 million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie.
The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the \""scariest movie ever made.\"" I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?"""

Other than getting to see Angie Baby in a pre-\""Police Woman\"" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing here.<br /><br />THE SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />*** MINOR SPOILERS ***<br /><br />David Norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural.
One day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger.
The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the \""Norliss tapes\"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural.<br /><br />In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death.
We soon discover the ring itself doesn't grant immortality.
Instead, it only reanimates the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood.<br /><br />Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven't heard since you last watched \""Scooby Doo\"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night.
She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate.<br /><br />So is this guy a vampire? No.
There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard.
The sculptor doesn't drink his victims' blood -- he collects it.
How? Don't know.
We only see him attacking, never collecting.
Why? To fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality.
It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood.
Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway into our world.<br /><br />THE FINAL ANALYSIS:<br /><br />\""The Norliss Tapes\"" wasn't picked up as a series for a very good reason...
it was garbage.
As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, ill-conceived mess.
The acting and dialogue offer no better.

9919_3	"In the opening scene of \Malta Story\"" Mr A.Guinness bore such a startling resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be \""Certain women need striking regularly - like gongs\"" or some such world - weary bon mot.
Unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the Master would have had trouble bringing it to life.
Indeed Mr Guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one.
And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.
Mr J.Hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a \""Jack Hawkins\"" performance without an ounce of individuality.
It could have been spliced from any of a dozen British war movies.
Many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose.
The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring London to its knees.The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the King and the island was awarded the George Cross.

I'm sure you will recognize some \""laugthers\"" I saw last night in cinema."""
4985_2	"In 1993, \the visitors\"" was an enormous hit in France.
So, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made.
<br /><br />This is a movie that doesn't keep its promises.
Indeed, it's supposed to tell a sole story.
Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course.
The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard...
Instead of this, the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot.
As a consequence, the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed, sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors.
Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying.
Then, why did Jean-Marie Poiré the film-maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role? He made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful.
The other actors aren't better: Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable.<br /><br /> Of course, the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness.
Certain sequences and dialogs are affected.
It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie.
Thus, a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.<br /><br />A labored and disappointing follow-up.
Anyway, what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?<br /><br />"""
3288_1	"Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines, in spite of the good box office returns.
If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next, STOP.
Stop making our TV shows into these repellent, stupid, money grubbing waste of time movies that suck.
By doing so you are proving one thing: Hollywood is out of ideas, and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust.
What's next -- You guys gonna go & ruin The Bionic Man??<br /><br />The film is just plain wrong, and manages to get the most stupid, simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting (or ignoring) that Tom Wopat & John Schneider's Bo & Luke Duke were *REFORMED* moonshiners.
They had been busted, learned their lesson, gone straight, and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen.
Denver Pyle's Uncle Jessie was also the moral center of the family, always insisting that the Boys do good, even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done.
They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naiveté about them that was quite appealing.
We wanted to be more like them than we were, sorta.
My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off, which was apparently too moral for this film.<br /><br />By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering, wisecracking, criminally minded, redneck baiting, misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint, where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were -- Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys? I wanted to punch them both in the nose.
They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends, if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven't grown up.
There should be no marijuana use, no gawking at buxom, nubile coeds & their breasts, no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood.
All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies.
The problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show, IMHO shouldn't be seeing this movie either, and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers, director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money, which is exactly how I feel.
What were they thinking???<br /><br />And boy did they *EVER* get Daisy wrong.
Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace, but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her, printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom.
She is hardly in the film at all (which is the movie's only saving grace), and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive.
Catherine Bach's Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts, and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her, but the Daisy she played was a *PERSON*.
The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it.
She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home.
And most importantly she was a sweet, caring person who couldn't help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her.<br /><br />By contrast, Jessica Simpson appears phony, contrived, made up, costumed, posed, aloof, bored, out of place, and I don't think she even looks that great in the outfit.
She doesn't look like a person but a plot device, conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent.
Ms.
Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened.
Whatever the joke was, she isn't in on it and is disgracefully exploited for T&A.
If that's all she wants from her career, executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least, because this effort was just pathetic.<br /><br />The bottom line is SKIP IT.
For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros.
excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together.
That was why it worked.
The only real purpose I can see in the film might be it's future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay.
Twenty minutes of this & they'll be singing a choir.<br /><br />1/10, and I mean it.
And STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE BIONIC MAN, you schnooks."
3456_4	"Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, what a great director she'll one day turn out to be, etc.
I think they're just being nice.
Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does.
\The next Jane Campion\"", they call her; and, even apart from the fact that they're both over-rated, the two have SO much in common.
They both direct movies.
They're both women.
They're both Australian.
(Well, give or take.)<br /><br />Yep: it's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant, and we just have to swallow hard and accept it.
But I'll say this for Carruthers: she's cute.
-And fascinating.
No, really.
Here are some thoughts on her lack of talent:<br /><br />(1) Part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people.
Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her? So as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed, I expect.<br /><br />(2) Why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set I have ever seen? After all, it must have been filmed on a REAL movie set.
How could they get it wrong? If Rendall's set was half as much of an under-staffed shambles it's a wonder he completed his film at all.<br /><br />(3) Carruthers - the fictional director - has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick.
Fat chance.
I doubt it can be done these days.
I suspect that Rendall - the actual, and more talented, director - set himself the same task, realised it couldn't be done, and settled for (sigh) knowing parody instead.
Of course, it's not ENOUGH of a parody to work as a parody.
As soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ...
well, less badly.<br /><br />(4) And yet, and yet ...
the film opens with not a parody but an honest-to-goodness pastiche of 80s horror, starring (this is too good to be true) Molly Ringwald.
This pastiche is much better than anything that follows.
(It's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie-within-the-movie, rather than the movie.) Yet it, too, was filmed in the late 1990s.
Perhaps it IS still possible to make 1980s horror.
You just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and MEAN it.<br /><br />(5) I'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had Australian accents, but now I know.
And strangely, I'm glad I know.
A need I never knew I had has been fulfilled."""
8602_2	"All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten.
Then they start rolling the title credits: You see \Slugs!\"" in big letters, followed shortly thereafter by \""The Movie.\"" WHEW! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into \""Slugs: The Musical\"" or \""Slugs: The Game Show.\"" Anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a kill-fest.
You see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people get attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs.
It's a pretty silly movie, falling in the \""so-bad-it's-good\"" category.
It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974).
I'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has here, because most people here don't give those types of movie any love.
But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, this is one of your prime candidates."""
8108_3	"After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed.
This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad.
Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie.
I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here.
Instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel', in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy.<br /><br />Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic.
In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina.
The introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives Tomas' story more significance than it does make it light.<br /><br />There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is Kundera's style.
This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film.
A film which is as long as it is uncompelling.
For those who haven't read the book yet I recommend just reading that.
For those who have, I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings."
8662_1	"What an awful movie.
I love monster flicks but I couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting, cardboard characters and abysmal special effects.
There is nothing redeeming about this movie.
The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous, uninspiring sock puppets.
The plot is formulaic, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drivel.
Even the CGI is horrible.
You know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy.
No surprises here,just same old same old.
This is truly one of the worst films ever made.
Director Roger Corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata."
7064_2	"\John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!\"" I thought as I checked the flick's info here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night, having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2.<br /><br />I've just finished watching it, and sadly it was downhill from there on.
Arguably you can't spoil a film this poor, but I'll leave the spoilers out of this review...
<br /><br />There's an awful lot of style over very little substance: unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release.
As for the substance, the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school-life; but beneath the shiny veneer, a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise.
Characters are painted in childishly broad strokes, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer's father sought to question in Breakfast Club.
<br /><br />Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up (perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information, which soon becomes a tiresome device, but at least pushes the story along), but his efforts don't sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting (how anyone is supposed to side with 'Maddox', when Blake Shields gurns and glowers his way through the part, I just can't understand), not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes (I'm all for creative license, but when the \""bad guys\"" know the identities of the \""good guys\"" making their lives a misery, but fail to act in any way to stop them, you really have to wonder why this script didn't undergo another few re-drafts before production - did Daddy even read it?).
<br /><br />I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film (and all power to them), but they're really better off sticking with Hughes Sr.'s high school output, and if the idea of school-time rebellion is what really appeals, the 1968 classic \""If...\"" is a much more satisfying examination of the subject."""
4610_4	"I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast.
I have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this sort of low-budget B movie.
She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in.
This is no different.
The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesn't make it good.
George Wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role.
Another note about Ms.
Wuhrer.
Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last.
Perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants.
This NOT a bad thing.
She still looks great.
I would like to see her in a better movie."

The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis.
But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting.

8390_3	"A director and his crew head out to the isolated Beal mansion, to make a low-budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the Beal family that have occurred there in the last century.
Even with warnings by the caretaker, the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house.
One of the crew find a book titled Tibetan Book of the Dead, and use some of the passages from it for their script.
But in doing so, when red they raise a ghoul from its grave.<br /><br />Boring, confusing and tacky all rolled up into one, equals this penniless midnight horror production.
What feels like an eternity, it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas.
Even though director Paul Harrison's clunky, tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie, moody and atmospheric set-pieces.
But laziness did set it early.
The whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest.
Nor is it fun.
Think of Bob Clark's \Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things (1972)\"", and now we've got older actors in the part.
However I found \""Seven Corpses\"" to be inferior.
The script early on has some cutting wit abound, before it ends up being drab, predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities.
The cheap foundation involving limited sets didn't help matters either, but the mansion's dreary, dark appearance had a creepy air to it.
Performances from a recognizable b-cast is mainly rigid.
John Carradine in small part mainly lurks about.
John Ireland plays a hot-headed director, Faith Domergue's washed-up actress demands attention and Charles Macaulay hams it up.
The slow grinding premise is crossed between \""Ten Little Indians\"" and your usual zombie set-up.
However its not all that engaging, even with its occult and supernatural edge.
Hell they even throw in some graveyard action, with no prevail.
When the rotting ghoul makes its appearance finally, but a bit late.
It does get a little better, if very baffling.
Just like the inspired opening, the ending is deliciously downbeat.
To bad in between, it constantly drags.
Continuity in many scenes comes across non-existent, and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier (but indeed poorly executed) in the movie they're making, then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears.
The generic music score flounders on with its shuddery, but frank Gothic cues, and the camera-work is blandly staged with a lack of imagination.

2349_1	"There was a great film to be made about Steve Biko.
Sadly this wasn't it.
Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had.
Attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable.
The Soweto massacre wasn't like this, three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels!) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers.
With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce.
If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family.
I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he wasn't.

6250_1	"I really did like this show, once upon a time.
That is, until I realized all the faults in it.
It's so unrealistic.
I know it's fiction, but it isn't even the slightest bit believable.
Here's why.
**Spoilers ahead folks...** Are we really supposed to believe that a kid like Yugi would be descended from a Pharaoh of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He's the biggest nerd on the face of the Earth.
And what's up with the Pharaoh (a.k.a.
Atem and/or Yami's) hair? Last I checked, Pharaohs were shaved (except for a small bit of hair atop the head) and wore fancy hats.<br /><br />And, are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius, named Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like 'Domino High'? Puh-leeze! First off, he'd have to legally be an adult to run a company.
And that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius, since he'd be the only adult in his class.
And second off, why would he attend a school like 'Domino High', when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy snobbish academy? Plus, the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame.
Every time you turn around, that kid's been kidnapped by goons for the baddie.
*yawn* Nothing new, nothing new.<br /><br />Joey is the poor kid, who lives with a good-for-nothing father.
It says that Joey earns all the money to attend his school, because his father's an alcoholic, but you never once see Joey do anything that resembles work.
He doesn't even mention work.
And his sister Serenity is a complete moron.
Why would she choose a snob like Duke (who dressed her brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television) over a nice guy like Tristan? Is she really that clueless? Various characters throughout the show, get possessed by demonic forces, get their souls stolen by demonic forces, and fall prey to mental illness.
(Oh, that's child-safe, NOT.) Tea is the typical girl-next-door type, whose only purpose is to be Yugi/Yami's girlfriend.
And while she has some cool points to her, she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a main character.<br /><br />The animation is simply awful.
All the characters look sickly and anorexic.
The perspectives are terrible (especially when they do close-ups of somebody's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar.<br /><br />But the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that Yami says that his Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies.
If this was so, how come he didn't save Yugi's Grandpa in the first place, when Pegasus stole his soul, and save himself the trouble of getting it back?<br /><br />All it really is, is a commercial for itself.

Now he's adapted another Gujarati play and named it Waqt - a race against time.
In sum, the emotions are alien.
The plot development is not for Hindi films.
For example, the role play between father and son is best left to Gujarati Theatre - don't bring it in a Hindi film.

The casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty-somethings.
As other reviewers on here have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that,) are a bunch of Brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap.
We are left to assume that this group of 'children' were the only students at this school, as their 'reunion' is only them at the school, which is now shown to be abandoned, is just them.
<br /><br />The kills are lame, the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: 'This place gives me the creeps...'
and 'Someone gimme a beer' are highlights...It's just not good.
Skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher.
If you wanna see good, get Bava's \""Bay Of Blood,\"" done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better.
If you wanna see a good BAD slasher, see \""Just Before Dawn\"" or \""The Burning.\"" 2 out of 10, kids."""
1144_4	"Recap: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy, knowledge that might unbalance the world.
He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union.
KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology.
So, they sets a scheme in motion.
During a rescue attempt to free Markov, KGB steps in, takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden, and working for the UN.
As a backup, KGB kidnaps Markov's estranged daughter.
CIA now send their best agents, a team of (Swedish?) Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter.<br /><br />Comments: A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing.
The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas.
First off is that it is very dark, probably to conceal locations and bad effects, that some scenes are hard to comprehend.
You can't see what is happening.
The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts, despite being a ninja-movie.
Sure there are some, of quite poor quality, but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions.
The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition.
And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies.<br /><br />What does it have that speaks for it then? The idea and ambition foremost.
Some actually, and especially for a Swedish movie, decent action-scenes albeit not of martial arts.
Some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore.
And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode.
Mostly all parts that you look for in a B-movie.<br /><br />Because it definitely is a B-movie, no mistake could be made there.
But if you expect it, and watch it like a B-movie, it is entertaining.
But don't forget, it is not only a B-movie it is set in the eighties.
Some girls, for example, besides wearing...
lets say \interesting\"" clothes, have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup.<br /><br />In all, see for the cult status and the ambition.
Enjoy it, and then forget it.<br /><br />4/10"""

This is also the main reason that fans of the TV show won't like the movie, but not the only reason.
This movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal.
It approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making, and then gets even worse.
I won't waste your time describing this movie in further detail; suffice it to say that I pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this c**p the first time."

8909_2	"This movie is lame and not funny at all.
The plot doesn't even make sense.
Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent 
reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a
 skimpy outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?)
 The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, 
and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently.
There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie.
I'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either.
The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing.
Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing.
I didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal.
I don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, I can't think of any part of the movie that was good."

5379_2	"Released on DVD in the UK as Axe, The Choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film which comprises mostly of people wandering around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are quite obviously destined to be the film's survivors), everyone is thoroughly objectionable,
 meaning that the viewer couldn't care less when they get slaughtered; the deaths aren't gory enough (unless a brief shot of a pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns your stomach); and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity (an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flick!).
<br /><br />The wafer-thin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are picked off by an unseen assailant.
For a low budget effort, the production values are okay, and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors, but with not nearly enough genuine scares, a reluctance to get really messy (this is a slasher, so where's the graphic splatter?), way too much dreadful dialogue (particularly from the not-dead-soon-enough drummer) and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie quickly becomes extremely boring."

Once more the dogs are the only \actors\"" that seem \""real\"" and thats a stretch.
Another wasted effort here.
GRADE: D"""
9646_1	The Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most.
First i though that people was going to compare this to Rock On! but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than Rock On! So-so story Horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you gotta be kidding me.
The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad! Vipul Shah hasn't still learn from Singh is King's critically bashed comedy.
Now Asin..
where do she come from sorry for Asin's fan out there but she suck*d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all overdose of make-up! My final verdict go watch Aladin with your family instead wasting your time here.

9958_1	"If utterly facile, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilisation juvenilia appeals to you, then this is the ideal film.
Very poorly scripted, with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand-held camera throughout, this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic, Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive and bumbling at best, and predatory monsters at worst.
The only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming (yawn) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the woods, with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again, in the woods (naturally...).
Displays all the weaknesses of a first film, and plenty more besides."
8994_2	"This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film.
You've got future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken,Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse, uninspired fart and racist jokes.
The concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes, but instead right out the gate, makes a lame, juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way.
Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie.
This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70's sketch comedy movies."
4295_2	"This is yet another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy.
It begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie.
I kept waiting for it to pick-up, but unfortunately it never did.
The acting is fair, but the script needs A LOT of work.
And if you're looking for the nudity, don't waste your time with these not so hot actors.
Due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie.
If you have never seen over five gay films, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you may find this film interesting, otherwise it's your run-of-the-mill low budget movie.
It ranks as one of the worst gay films I have ever seen."
7953_1	"While the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit - the storyline is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country name simply changed.

Nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm.
<br /><br />Aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the South African Defence Force, it serves little purpose - definitely no entertainment value.<br /><br />Aspiring movie makers - this is how not to make a war movie.

4385_3	"Satan's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I have seen.
When I say better I mean the story.
The film hatches a new plot, something that's not so cliché in the Horror genre - something fresh.
But there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it.
Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie.<br /><br />The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV.
I was tired of all the so called \terrifiying\"" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different.
The cover art for Satan's Little Helper immediately caught my attention.
As you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance.
I mean, I just seen \""Boogey Man\"" the night before - so It couldn't get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semi-satisfied.
I loved the plot of the movie.
It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill.
In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror.
It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night.
This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid.
They would simply think he was his guardian.
But, this is also where the \""plot holes\"" begin to surface.<br /><br />If your son came home with a \""friend\"" he met trick or treating - that's fine.
You wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him.
If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child.
You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself.
You would ask why he is with your son.
He doesn't know him.
You would tell him to please leave.
He isn't a family friend.
He's a stranger.
Now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers.
In this case, the mum is completely fine with it.
Huh? They never seem to think it's a tad odd that the \""man\"" doesn't speak - at all.
Gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word.<br /><br />The film goes down hill from there.
The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was \""Do you want some cider?\"".
I can't count how many times she says this in the movie.
It's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver.
It was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver.
I guess you could call it a \""Dud\"",\""Flop\"" etc..<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is the cover art.
Though, something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars!"""
9490_1	"This is complete and absolute garbage, a fine example of what a BAD movie is like, this can't be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans.
Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash.
Bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but I mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment (of any form) is.
I bought the DVD for 3 dollars, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it.
Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me.
I like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near.
You know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even.
Just plain old pathetic."
10345_4	"By 1941 Columbia was a full-fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM, Paramount or Warners.
That's the best thing that could be said about \Adam Had Four Sons,\"" a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman (top-billed for the first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter.
Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (this was the era in which Hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another) hired as governess to Baxter's four sons and staying on (with one interruption caused by the stock-market crash of 1907) until the boys are grown men serving in World War I.
Just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good it's a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous.

Poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone.
Why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof (and a damn funny one at that) as it stands? The sets are laughable, the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable, and the acting farcical.
It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage.
National Lampoon once made Animal House, which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious.

So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story.
There is the buried set, some wolf headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is.
What I would have missed, had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase, some really bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialog, more bad C.G.I., and the hero fighting paper cut outs.
Other than the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities.

12112_2	I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie.
I couldn't even call it a movie.
It was so bad with nothing to recommend it.
<br /><br />I like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death.
Badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious.
You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie.
I wonder what I was thinking watching it to the end.
I recommend this movie to no one.
How did they release this? Was there an audience who likes this kind of movie? There must be because you can find this at almost any video store.
But why?<br /><br />Deserves to be forgotten.<br /><br />If you like bad movies then this is for you.
6484_1	"I suppose it was for Temple Matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse.
SPOILERS: It is much similar to the original.
Melody, Ariel's new daughter is threatened by Ursula's sister, Morgana.
Morgana escapes, but keeps her promise to take Melody away from them.
Did Ursula have a sister?! And she is not that great a villain as Ursula was.
This is where there is similarity.
Medoly is kept from the sea until Morgana is captured, but she doesn't know a thing about it, because it all happened when she was a baby.
A wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out.
She goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with Sebastian, who is not as funny or fun as in the original.
She finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds Morgana.
Here is a similarity; Morgana tricks Melody, making her happy by turning here into a mermaid.
Meanwhile, Eric, Melody and King Triton look for her.
To stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from Triton.
So Melody does, because she does not know King Triton is her father.
She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful.
The penguins who live with them in an icy ocean, hate them because they are cowards.
So they try to prove they are heroes and fail.
That does not suit the little mermaid.
And the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear-bleeding.
you know why? Because the first had a great story.
This one is not and is not magical.
It is just an example of how bad many sequels are.<br /><br />Melody finds them and they help to take her to Atlantica to prove themselves.
When they take the trident, Ariel finds Melody with Morgana.
Melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to Morgana, then she shows her true colours once she grabs it.
Poor Ariel and Melody are in her custody.
The penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight Morgana's shark friend.
Sorry I did not mention him earlier.
They finally prove themselves.
Eric, King Triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before Morgana by the power of the trident.
Melody takes it, throws it to Triton and he ices Morgana (literally).
Then Ariel apologises to Melody and thinks it is all her fault.
It was not! Ariel did the right thing to protect Melody, but they never say so.
Triton offers Melody to live in sea or land.
She in fact has a \better idea\"".
She uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer-folk can be together.
Then everyone sings an awful song.
THE END.<br /><br />Whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original.
I do not dislike this because I am a teenager.
I liked it when I was very very little.
Then as I grew older I began to see what is bad about this film.
young, young kids will enjoy it, but it is likely that when they are in primary school, they will forget about it.
Normally I would think I over-judged a film and it was better than I remember when I watched it again, but not this one.
It is even worse.
Story is no exception.
If you thought, by reading this that the story is good, read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points: Well, you know the story now.
I am sorry for spoiling it for you, but I had to point out some bad parts of it.
One of the worst things is the animation.
Colour is awful.
The original had beautiful colour.
Watching this almost made me want to go blind.
Even the illustrations and landscape design were not good.
The original had beautiful, magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well, making it a joy to watch.<br /><br />The music is unbearable.
Compared to the first, the music here is crap.
Songs are not that well composed and Tara Strong (I think that is her name) who did Melody can not sing.
She at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song.
So much for having \""Melody\"" as a name.And the music is not at all beautiful or moving.
Little Mermaid 1 won an Oscar for it and it truly deserved it.
This one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist.<br /><br />I did not like the voices.
Several people who played characters from the first, did the same ones in this.
Jodi Benson is a great singer, but now that she is older, no offence to her, her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore.
And I am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this.
If I was chosen for this film, just by reading the script, I can tell it would be a bad film.
The characters are different now.
Ariel is more wiser now, but annoying.
They overdid her character, making her too mature.
In sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason.
She was sixteen in the first.
There is little chance she changes.
That is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life.
Screenwriters should think of that.
They should think of the character.<br /><br />Well, I suppose that is it for me.
I hope you find my comment useful, because I am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view."""
6650_3	"I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light.
My family is from the southeast region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles).
I have never heard the people I grew up around talk like these folks did.
The Cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks.
Most of the Cajuns I know are well educated, proud people and don't sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did.
All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenery and music.
I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please have the actors study the language, live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them.
In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much more enjoyable movie!"
9925_1	"This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, itself brilliant, but not this.
Nowhere did I see Mel Brook's name on here and I can guess why, he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot.
My gawd, who would find this funny.
Sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny, well cause it's simply not funny.
It's like the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with Blazing Saddles.
Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they didn't care.
It was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out.
I guess it's useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be."
4235_4	"I just finished watching this movie.
I was very excited since I'm a big fan of Punk Rock, Horror films and Spoofs.
I was very surprised at what I saw.
I knew it was low budget, but I wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera.
It opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, The Horrorpops, reforming their song, Where They Wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways.
It's a great opening.
But the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was.
A live performance, A death.
Another live performance, A death.
It gets old.
And there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes.
Why doesn't the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? Don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome.
Like the hardcore French band, known simply as BERET, the prospect of a band named Atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and Bowling For Soup's Overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that I will save for the future watchers of this movie.
But the big problem I have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the \actors\"".
Especially Warped Tour creator, Kevin Lyman.
He tries very hard, but I suspect that he didn't want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something.
In addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the DVD.
The Movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random.
something about a magic sword and Lloyd Kaufman as the devil.
Bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent Horror, Music, or Comedy film.
Although I have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that I would never have listened to, otherwise.
Such as Tsunami Bomb, and the Phenomonauts(an insane, Psychobilly band).
I recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on.
If not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances.
They rock! Long live Punk Rock and Horror!"""
9546_3	"If you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece.
How could it be worse more you ask? Well...at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra.
Other than updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story.
Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going.
And for anyone that didn't see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once.
Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again."
3711_4	"I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I based my judgments on a friend's opinions.
Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on its face.<br /><br />During the movie Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy.
The movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it that endeavor it fails.
The love story in the movie is straight forward (luckily), but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rock serious and bland.
After all, the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy, where laughter should be the primary concern.
Not much of that in the movie.<br /><br />The plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole.
Some parts were discontinuous altogether.
If the supporting cast were meant to be funny, they certainly didn't do a good job.
The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull.
Rock's first incarnation's couple of underlings were also bland.
If there's one thing they did do right, though, they made Rock seem funnier by comparison."

The best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was..., nope can't think of one for that either.
You knew who the killer was right from the start.
There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her top off.

That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode & the patronising British episode).
If Columbo had been made as per the original 'pilot' it certainly would NOT have gone on for very long, or be watched and loved world-wide.
In this film Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive.

8503_1	"with all the European studios involved in this one, you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography; but the local color is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Irritation #1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent in order to play a Spanish cop - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused.
There's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn't she a lesbian? - serving no purpose whatsoever.
The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time.
There seems to be some message about the mid-'30s Spanish Civil War But since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead, one doesn't see the point in it.<br /><br />Despite the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative (which part? who can tell), you never even get a good look at a bull fight.

when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work, and offered me work, i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $100,000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left myself $10-20000 for NL $1-2 and $2-5 cash games at the casinos.
i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll.
instead i win about $1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all.
i was only homeless cause i didn't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes i had over $1000-2000 in my sock while i slept outside.
anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs.

1405_3	"\A Damsel in Distress\"" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals.
But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments.<br /><br />In \""Damsel,\"" Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour.
He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.<br /><br />Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt.
He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry.
Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.<br /><br />This musical has numerous problems.
First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G.
Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay).
The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating.
When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.<br /><br />The butler and the house boy are especially irritating.
They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth.
You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.<br /><br />Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers.
Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical.
She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.<br /><br />George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary.
The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.<br /><br />The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done.
At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus.
There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood.
(They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards.
And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.<br /><br />But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged.
At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing.
The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot.
(At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include:  \""I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now\"" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street.
He does some great \""cane-twirling\"" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus.
(In the Broadway musical, \""Crazy For You,\"" Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)<br /><br /> \""Put Me To The Test\"" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage.
George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.<br /><br /> \""Stiff Upper Lip\"" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors.
It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.<br /><br /> \""Things Are Looking Up\"" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate.
Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.<br /><br /> \""A Foggy Day in London Town\"" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London.
At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.<br /><br /> \""Nice Work If You Can Get It\"" -- A great song that is misused in the movie.
During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song.
Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave.
(Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in \""Crazy For You.\"")  \""Drum Dance Number\"" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums.
As usual, it's a great dance number.
But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.<br /><br />The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine.
As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree.
Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.<br /><br />The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote.
The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers."""

Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled.

Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry).
Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress.

7931_3	"The explosion of TV channels must be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line, because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred Randolph Scott movies playing on at least one no-budget station.
<br /><br />\Man Behind The Gun\"" is a typical early 1950's period melodrama with pre-WWII production values that relies on a historically-topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script's complete absence of character development, and thus lack of suspense.
In years to come the role of these films would be taken over by TV shows like 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc - and these actually did the job better.
Randolph Scott, looking particularly grizzled in this, is the good guy, struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail.
There's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling, unless you count wondering whether he'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end.
The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the 'characters' than the acting is.

5976_3	"The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys.
And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given.

She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise!

Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie.
And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!<br /><br />For the first time I could think of, how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, \""You were warned!\"" Instead, it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world.
Advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin \""pursue your dream\"" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!<br /><br />And finally, the music.
There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene).
Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened.
But the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet.
Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!<br /><br />Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about.

8811_1	"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched half of this movie and I didn't like it.
<br /><br />First reason: Boring.
Barely anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weed, read magazines, care for their sick friend, and cut up the occasional dead body.
BORING!!!!<br /><br />Second reason: There are too many things left unexplained.
Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, restrains them in a chair and interrogates them.
Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters? Why does he kill one and let another one go?<br /><br />Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought-never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /><br />Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologue tedious, and the action non-existent.
Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't.
I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick, I will from now on make sure I read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie I regret seeing."

Don't bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children.
They might laugh, especially if they're off their meds.
There's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort, but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing.
This film, frankly, ticked me off royally.

I had no idea that this was a movie.
I thought it was some news program or something.
I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'War of the Worlds.'
So, recently, I get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix).
I can tell you, I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting.
I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? I don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.<br /><br />The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close.

I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You watch yours (together): I wont leave you behind!<br /><br />The first action sequence shows how awful the production is, but its really kind of funny: Good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 sub-machine guns.
Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, to top it all off, they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M-16s!! I think they had a budget shortage for guns, not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys.
Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell.
You have to remove the pin/spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own.
You can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter.
Weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re-appear.
When a gun is out of bullets, throwing it away is still pretty stupid.

Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known.
Fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college).

5940_4	"Look,I'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that I wanna say but I will try to make it short but clean...<br /><br />First of all, lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made...How it didn't show anything of Notorious and I agree with the most people here saying that it was \Hollywood\"", I mean, what did you expect a real life story? When will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie...
Its all covered up and buried deep down.<br /><br />Second, I'm not against neither 2pac or Biggie I love them both but 2pac and Lil Kim DID get embarrassed in this movie for sure...<br /><br />Next, for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth, either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about BIG or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this Hollywood teenage movies.
Use your mind and see though the clouds...
There is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a little bit, I mean a much better done.
But anyways I'm just some person giving her opinion....No hard feelings...
<br /><br />Look, I love hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live.
With all do respect for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....
Bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets, hustling and just grabbing for the paper....
<br /><br />The true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all.
<br /><br />OK I know that many of you will think that I'm crazy, but this is just my point of view.
Look I am maybe wrong about something and Im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years I still don't know anything bout 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music...Like most of you all out there.
Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.
<br /><br />And for the end I just wanna say for all of ya Biggie and Tupac fans and family, this two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO BE BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER, THINK GOOD EVEN FOR THE ONES THAT Don't LIKE YOU, BECAUSE AT THE END...
ITS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME U COULD GET AND HOW FAST U COULD GET TO THE TOP, ITS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING YOUR SELF TO THE FULLEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MIND...BECAUSE IF U MANAGE TO DO THAT, YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH!!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO YA ALL!!!! RIP BIGGIE,2PAC,AALIYAH,LEFT EYE,JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS WHO MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD!!!!"""
9211_2	"This film reminds me a lot of the anti-drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about.
Tom Hanks and his buddies are \role playing\"", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing Hanks falling for the lady in the group.
quite funny but misguided.
I wonder how many poor kids had their D&D stuff destroyed, and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction.
As a film it's basically an after school special, bad acting (although Hanks does show some of his talent) and relationship talks, and no one seems to be having any fun.
It seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does.
Despite my vote of 2, this is worth watching due to its unique genre, scare films, which I personally find quite funny."""
6674_3	"I'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez, who helmed the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project.
Besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I enjoyed.
<br /><br />But nope, unfortunately I felt that for the most parts, Altered is a waste of time, so I shall keep this review short.
Premises are always promising, and Altered's no different.
It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff.
Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so I shall not go into details, but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget.
<br /><br />What if you're given a chance for revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive.
What will you do? For this group, it's a gleeful payback time, or so they thought.
And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting.
Even if it's low budgeted, there aren't many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting.
It's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.
<br /><br />What's good though is the makeup.
Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I shan't mention, because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable.
Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.
<br /><br />Watch this only as a last resort.
Compared to the other monster movie in town - Feast, this one is less fun, and takes itself too seriously.
Bogged down by an uninspiring direction, you've been warned."
10796_1	"This film proves that the \commercial\"" cinema ,or else,the Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis.
There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on Shaquille's name.
There is no worth referring to the plot :it is a bit more perplexed than a knot.What else?The screen is somewhat dim,O'Neal is a bad actor but Francis Capra is even worse.
<br /><br />Rating: 1 / 10."""
8063_2	"I have anticipated the various Sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film.
While some people walked out of the film, I decided to stay, only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting, lack of suspense, ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line.
I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film.
The only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack.
This is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing.
In retrospect, I wouldn't even rent this one, let alone pay more than $5 to see."
9209_1	"First off, I knew nothing about 'Mazes and Monster' before I watched it.
I had no knowledge of the Role-playing controversy behind it or the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie.
When I looked at the cover (the updated DVD one) I seriously thought it would be another Fantasy adventure like 'Legend', with Tom Hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters.
Sounds exciting, right? That is what the cover suggests to you at first glance.
I was given this movie as a gift, obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows I'm into action movies with a medieval myth theme.
And it has Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors.
So I popped this movie in, expecting a feel good movie with Tom Hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laugh.
<br /><br />No! None of this happens.
Now before I continue I will confess, I am a nerd but I have no interest in Role-playing games.
That is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best.
And M&M (copyright infringement?) is not even a feel good role-playing based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness.
No! This is an Anti-Role-playing movie that must have been made by some Religious folk (the same people who also think Barney is the work of Satan.) I understand, Satan is a crafty fellow but I don't think he is desperate enough for soul to lull RPG lovers into worship him.
This movie is THEE anti-gamer movie.
This is what I get from this movie: it hates RPGs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in Role-playing but it makes poor Tom Hanks a mental patient.<br /><br />Tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in 'Castaway', poor guy was alone but Tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the Volleyball as a lovable character through Tom's good acting.
I wish I watched that movie instead of this.
In this movie, Tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature (it looks like a poorly made mascot for a RPG team) and has a split personality that is creepy at best.
Tom's acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else.
I get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic.
I am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to 'M&M' made me feel like cr*p.
Luckily I watched 'Hudson Hawk' afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further.
Yah, 'HH' surpasses 'M&M' by .
a LOT! This is not one of Tom's better films.
In fact it is thee most depressing movie I've ever seen him in (Even 'Saving Private Ryan' is not this depressing).
I walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and I ended up feeling the exact opposite.
If you want to watch a sad (both emotionally and visually) movie then by all means watch this.
If this movie is to convey a message, it is this: \Don't play RPGs if you are Cuckoo for Coco-Puffs.\"""""
10205_2	"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her \before\"" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms.
Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the \""before\"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic.
Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.
<br /><br />The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films.
As has the \""good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence\"" character been seen before.
In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes.
<br /><br />One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising.
Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer.
You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer."""
6811_4	"When I first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago, I loved it.
I still think the directing and cinematography are excellent, as is the music.
But it's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more.
I find Emma Thompson's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a side-character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe Elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments', and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.
<br /><br />I do understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie, those are the things always difficult to digest.
<br /><br />As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne.
She is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully, without too much sentimentality.
Alan Rickman is great, a bit old perhaps, but he plays the role beautifully.
And Elizabeth Spriggs, she is absolutely fantastic as always."
8294_1	"There may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer.
Suffer they do, in this dreary, truly dreadful film, but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non-dental variety too.
If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, barfing kids, sick kids, lots of long, long meaningful glances, a deadpan wife and a concerned husband: it's all here for you.
Boring, overlong, it stands out as one of those examples that scream out: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes, there is.
There is a short scene from Nabucco, with some pretty good singing.
Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save your time.
You can always read a book or make an omelette."
6585_3	"In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana.
Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training.
<br /><br />But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them.
It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit.
The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense.
<br /><br />Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas.
The film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train.
They're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade.
<br /><br />One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon.
It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing.
<br /><br />But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one.
Richard Widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon.
And no way would have he worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting.
He's have just let the MPs deal with him
br /><br />Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity.
But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day.
<br /><br />I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you weren't worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95% of the time.
But there ain't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits.
Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just doesn't let happen.
<br /><br />I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon.
The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman.
It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination."
440_3	"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /><br />Recap: Mia (Helin) is returning home from capital Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday.
She is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén).
Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved a town away.
Mia is still single and is focused on her career.
There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle.
As the party goes on (and alcohol consumed), more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise...
<br /><br />Comments: To be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years.
There are really no new elements or ideas.
This movie draws upon three basic areas.
1) Embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves.
2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety.
This move has the focus on the last one, almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along.
No loss though, since the humor that is there is not funny.
The performances from the cast are good I guess, though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten.
I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none.
To conclude, there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this.
<br /><br />3/10"
12290_1	I and a friend rented this movie.
We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging.
The movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending.
We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.
1885_1	"If you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the film for you.
If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere.
There are many films that do this far better.
For example, try some of the darker films by Bergman.
The Filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end.
If you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example."
7188_4	"When I caught a glimpse of the title I thought are we going to get another try-hard hip slasher, but actually I found \7eventy 5ive\"" to be a mildly passable, and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid-section it picks up momentum for the final half-hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending.
It won't win awards for originality, because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills (usual cheap jump scares), location (secluded mansion) and motivation from other films.
The gleaming direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script.
Sometimes laughable, but nonetheless I was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe.
The performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast, however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing.
An always presentable Rutger Hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective.
A slickly made, but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold."""
4577_1	"I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film.
I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst).
Like others, I found this film to be an awful mix of \real\"" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda.
<br /><br />As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions.
True, I was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the \""consciousness\"" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term (\""consciousness\"") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify.
It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay \""Politics and the English Language.\"" To refer to \""consciousness\"" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as \""based in science\"" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states \""democratic republics\"" and Hitler when he called his party a \""socialist workers\"" movement.<br /><br />I don't claim to really understand quantum physics.
I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study.
Ah, but we Americans do love \""instant enlightenment,\"" and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish.
If it ASKED questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).
<br /><br />By the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several \""expert commentators\"" with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention J.Z.
Knight, who often speaks in her \""Ramtha\"" voice.
(I'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old Atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology.
But then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow.
Only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of \""good\"" and \""bad\"" advice, so it's all my fault, not Ramtha's.
)<br /><br />What a mess."""
7036_4	"I'm not ruining anything when I inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie.
If that is your thing, then your movie has arrived.
<br /><br />A woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods.
Her sister is a creepy lady to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love.
On the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan rituals.
<br /><br />The plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb.
The woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans, even continues the have sex with him.
On the exploitative side of things, there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings, but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else.
Oh, and the aforementioned goat-sex scene.
<br /><br />Most viewers won't make it to the end.
Exploitation fans will ride it out, but will be left wanting more.

5062_1	"This movie is bizarre.
Better put, it's \freakin' weird\"".
I could give you a plot summary, or some hoity toity analysis, but I would consider it a waste of your time.
All anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters, one incestuous relationship, homicide, post mortem mutilation, and one really disturbing infatuation.
At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself, but not in a good way like after \""Pulp Fiction\"" or \""Fight Club\"".
It's like you're a teenager (or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager)and have just done something you A: wish you hadn't done, and B: hope to the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about.
And nobody likes that.
My advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth, just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch \""Kazaam\""(yes, I would rather watch \""Kazaam\"" than \""Murderous Maids\"", read into it what you want)."""
435_2	"An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies.
You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies.
To disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days, he throws in The Matrix.
<br /><br />But it's not only the same lame film-as-art speech all over again.
This speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency.
<br /><br />It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having Zizte edited into the movies he is taking about.
For someone who is supposed to know much about movies, his own is, cinematographicly speaking: yeiks.
<br /><br />To put it in Zizek's own words - I saw 5\-\!7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />Mr.
(Zizek), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard.
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.
I award you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on your soul."
4799_2	"I myself am a big fan of low-budget 80's horror films.
This isn't the worst but still not to spectacular.
The plot line is decent but drags out way too long.
You're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action.
The kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty.
I truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick.
It's watchable but I feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life.
I'll give the film credit for being somewhat original.
If you are really into B horror movies it's worth a viewing but if you're not, don't bother.
But you don't have to take my word for it."
865_1	"I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad film.
It fails on pretty much all levels; the cast is awful, the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth, leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines.
<br /><br />Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy.
<br /><br />A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie."
1398_3	"I bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title \Grey Matter\"".
The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me.
As the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.
<br /><br />And yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it.
Some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript I guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings.
It's actually kinda funny.
After awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching \""Grey Matter\"".
<br /><br />I also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling.
At one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a \""Scientific b*tch!\"".
It's just a very inadequate insult.
Several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that \""scientific b**tard!\"".
It just sounded very awkward to me.

Another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it.
Almost like it never happened.

It wasn't.
This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats.
The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off.
even the nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this film? I don't think they did.
You can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes.
if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood.
Avoid this trash - I watched it on TV and felt riped off, so don't spend anything on it.
The best part is probably the end."
11095_1	"Probably the worst film I've ever seen, the acting and story were terrible and I almost fell asleep.

5222_3	"This is really a very bad movie.
Why? First of all, the story is bad.
It is an artificial story, combining all sorts of things together that make no sense.
It just seems a wrong experiment.
Secondly, the actors cannot play in a realistic manner.
They cannot even talk as an actor should.
Why did I buy this movie? And what must I do with it now?"

And it was.
I really felt sorry for the star-studded cast- Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress...
before she made this movie- Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances I know and love her for.
Fred's dad, played by Trevor Peacock (of Vicar of Dibley fame, amongst others), had about one line.
<br /><br />The plot was predictable and all over the place, and the humour was...
lacking.
(However, there was one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family...
that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) Don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train (actually- maybe the train would be better...)"
7911_3	"It wasn't notable enough to be truly horrible, it was just incredibly lame.
The story was not half bad, but the execution was just horrendous.
<br /><br />To start with, it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on.
It was just paced badly.
The dialog was so utterly un-sparkling, just flat and boring.
<br /><br />And the characters, cripes almightly, they made Deadpool boring.
How the hell do you make Deadpool boring? He wasn't even funny.
He wasn't crazy.
He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly.
<br /><br />Gambit was boring.
And since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around, or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air? And what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics.
A round bo staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly by twirling super-duper fast.
Which Gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway.
Nor Deadpool, especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography.
<br /><br />And this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know WTH they are doing, and know better than to use it in every.
single.
shot.
as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />Three of the most physical fighters in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed, and Wilson), and some of the worst fight choreography I have ever seen in recent film memory.
It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys.
<br /><br />And then you had the break out, with all these mutants who did nothing.
Even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod), did f-all when they got out.

965_4	"First I liked that movie.
It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments.
The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best!!! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R.
Benton - this man really had a very good taste!!! But the script writers disappointed me extremely.
The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together.
Don't like the ending.
The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright.
It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories.
The actors were good, they were really funny.
Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr.
was very funny in the dancing scene : )))...
But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting.
For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!! It would be a good movie, if not the ending and some missed human psychology."
3204_3	"While not as bad as it has been made to be (I have seen MUCH worse), this is still a very lame movie.
Basically a rehash of Siegel's \Coogan's Bluff\"", with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of Joe Don Baker, an unappealing actor if there was one.
<br /><br />However, Venantino Venantini is great (and great fun) as the bad guy, sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman.
He is the main reason to sit through this steampile, as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting, specially the girl.
Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic lead (watch \""Mondo Cane\"" to see him running away from women).
Looking here like a second-tier Ben Gazzara, he's given next to nothing to do.
It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately.
And all of it scored to generic 80's \""action movie\"" music that couldn't be more boring.<br /><br />Greydon Clark can make good B-Movies (\""Without Warning\""), but here he trips, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth.
Well, at least the Malta locations were nice, and there's Venantini to try to save the day.

This movie is about a guy who does meth and I don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about.
It has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar.
I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug.
The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line.
I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day.

10897_1	This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller).
I don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves.
I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed!! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.
5485_1	"Without reiterating what was said above about this movie, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film...the cast/location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc...It had a vague shadow of 'Don't look Now' about the storyline from the beginning.
A stay in different surroundings (Italy again) to dim the heartbreak of loss...or perhaps that's how I saw it? So consequently I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country....and I sat there and sat there....and guess what? nothing actually happens! and I mean nothing!! You are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous..You are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head...The eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys, had great scope to take the movie in another direction, the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise, the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age.
It felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect.
When the credits started to roll (unexpectedly) you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish."
10219_2	"Soldier Blue is a movie with pretensions: pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man, on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam.
Well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things.
What Soldier Blue actually is is pernicious, trite, badly made, dishonest rubbish.
<br /><br />Another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies.
What it is basically is a lame, clichéd, poorly acted \odd couple\"" romance - Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a Lucio Fulci splatter flick.
<br /><br />There is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, gore-drenched climax, in which cute little native American children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up, and large-breasted native American women are molested, raped and strung up - no excuse, that is, except box office.
(The massacre itself, whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention, is very badly staged and shot; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments, incidentally, which utilised real amputees in their filming.
Now that's what I call exploitation.
)<br /><br />Forget all the pap you've heard (including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie) about this being a \""protest\"", an indictment of American brutality towards the native peoples.
This film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the Cheyenne; had it done so it would have featured some involving native American characters, would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless, faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax.
Instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss (lousy actors both, in this at least), with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.
<br /><br />Which is a terrible shame, because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all of the real life massacres the US (and Britain, and all so-called \""civilised\"" nations) have participated in over the centuries (Iraq?).
this just isn't that movie."""
6584_1	"Being the only movie I was able to see at this year's \Nordische Filmtage\"" at Lübeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.
<br /><br />This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it.
<br /><br />First of all, the actors are not the best.
But even better actors would not have rescued the movie.
E.g.
the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend.
The so called \""sex-scene\"" was nothing else but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality), but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown.
Everything else was copied by other directors like e.g.
Lynch, but of course without their geniality.<br /><br />So, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time...
bad story, bad actors, pictures, that make you want to vomit...
<br /><br />1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here)."""
1351_1	"\The Bubble\"" is an effort to make a gay Romeo & Juliet type of story with an Israeli and a Palestinian, although it seems to come at it by way of \""Friends\"" or \""Beverly Hills 90210.\"" The characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line.
The movie seems torn between fluff and depth.
On the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as (in one example of many) some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand, and get answers like, \""Hey, we're here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation.
Don't get political!\"" Beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line, it's just one of many ham-fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests.
On the other hand, the movie's main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of \""Bent\"" a play about gays in a Nazi labor camp.
The scene on stage is awkwardly rushed, undermining its erotic power (understandable given the constraints of film-time, but still this could have been edited to much better effect.) and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film.
Too bad.
This play deserves much better.
<br /><br />The characters are so one-dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire (though the word seems inappropriate here) substance.
The aggressive soldier from the crack Golani brigade is named \""Golan.\"" The militant Palestinian is named \""Jihad.\"" The striving-for-chic faghag roommate is \""Lulu.\"" Anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in Palestine, whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as well, the rest of this fluffy fantasy.
When a Palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record Israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful, an ambulance shows up in minutes.
(The outcome of the birth serves to show the Palestinians as unappreciative of Israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac.) Altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance, not the series of bone-numbing, soul-crushing, humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth, death, or severe illness.
Ashraf, the Palestinian lover, seems to get through from Nablus to Tel Aviv with no problems, no papers, no hassles.
He just shows up whenever he likes.
When the Israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of Lucy Ricardo.
<br /><br />Against the backdrop of nice, supportive Israelis and surly homophobic Palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers.
<br /><br />Gay Israeli-Palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in Saleem's \""Salaam/Shalom\"" so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think.
<br /><br />Gloriously bad films  like the works of Ed Wood -- at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them.
This one doesn't even have that going for it.
Most of the sound track sounds like Simon and Garfunkel on quaaludes, and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes, the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre TV-movie-of-the-week."""
10153_4	"SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Not really a very good movie...
but I did like the idea behind it...
and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with.
The movie is ostensibly an \episode\"" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off \""danger zone\"" and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them.
The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune...
everyone else just winds up dead.
The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad.
None of the \""real\"" people seem real at all.
The actors playing the killers are kind of fun...
because they are portraying cheesy and over-the-top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types...
and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show.
The movie pretends to be done all in one take...
there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the \""danger zone\"" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera...
but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly (to hide the \""cuts\"" from one take to another, I would imagine)."""
1610_2	"What I found so curious about this film--I saw the full 4 hour roadshow version, is how oddly dispassionate it is.
For a film about 2 very charismatic men--Castro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire.
The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in.
Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half.
Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end.
Several of the reviews I've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely.
(One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.
)This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York.

A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.

Nothing could be further from the truth.
As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn, and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single-handed moved Russia into a direction of dominance.
The truth? She was only brought to St.Petersburg to be a wife and mother, and found she had to \""bond\"" with the dvoriane, the boyars, and the military just to survive.
So long as she did not challenge them she was able/ permitted to indulge her cultural wishes (filling up the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.).
There are so many proofs that she was not \""great,\"" but in this area of post-modern revisionism proof is not very popular.
YC is only a costume drama, a bit of fluff from Ted Turner that, like \""Peter the Great\"" in 1986, is one more example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West."""
8540_2	"As someone else mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat.
Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains.
First they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at, with increasing irritation to the audience, by Gaffari.
Once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?) What happens next I will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because I most assuredly couldn't.
Now, I like Eurohorror, and this woulda been better if only Artigot (writer AND director) had made some attempt at logical story telling.
The backdrop (Pyrenees?) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences.
The verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them.

<br /><br />(Minor spoilers ahead.
Hey, do you really care if a film of this quality is \spoiled?\"") Traci is a girl with a problem.
Psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite-sex parent.
But this girl seems to have one for her same-sex one, and I don't think there's a term for that.
It might be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose cute overbite, neo-flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters.
Here Dana is not only clueless to her daughter's conduct; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition.
<br /><br />It's possible that Dana misses Traci's murderous streak because truth be told, Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster.
It's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count.
<br /><br />A particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid who is described by Dana as around so long she's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say, \""I just fell off the tomato truck from Guadalajara.
\"" Carmen is so wise to Traci's scheming, she might also wear a sign saying, \""Hey, I'm the Next Victim!\"" Sure enough, Traci confronts Carmen as Carmen is making her way back from Mass, and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke.
I rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire.

Cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies, talking to the owner's brother.
Then cut to her wearing the first dress, in the first location, under cloudy skies - but it's supposed to be later.
You get the picture.

The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted, stiff dialogue.
On a technical note, the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times.
Then again, this could be called a blessing.
Overall, this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minutes.

)<br /><br />More often than not -the relativity of the scenes in WURB are made relevant by a third person narrator.
Even more troubling is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in opening narration we're told WURB takes place shortly after the original.
) At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co-anchorwoman/lover.
In this film, he's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to Veronica (quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman spliced in to WURB.
) <br /><br />The part that makes this a movie, a continually evolving story, involves a bank-robbing clan without a cause called the Alarm Clock.
These scenes are almost painful to sit through.
This part was scrapped from the original scripts for Anchorman.
<br /><br />The majority of other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate/deleted takes on scenes from Anchorman.
They go to the same party as in the original, the same original \group bitching about having a woman on the team\"" scene, and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica had objections to reporting.

Oh, and they're wearing the same clothes as on their original date.

<br /><br />The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids: Stewart and Claire's son who is being led around by a half-breed Aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before.
The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised).
<br /><br />Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface).
None, that is, until Claire forces them to.
<br /><br />The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted.
There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done; too many loose threads.
The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible.
Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production.
<br /><br />I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my all-time favorites in that vein.
But Jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems, which simply didn't happen."
159_4	"I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor.
I therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts.
Her character's rescue from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft.
The trip had been turned down by the US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities.
The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the South Pole base.
I feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task.
I fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a USAF Hercules."
4017_1	"Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre.
Still, I did not like this one at all.
About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life.
Crappy sex scenes to follow.
Why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act.
I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not.
Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at.
Of course the girls in that one are very cute.
Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things.
If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film.
The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre...I mean there is a snake in one of them people.
So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off."

Stale predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack, punctuate this noxious mental narcotic's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill, or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma.
But it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average American a personage to which they can truly identify.

It's all tiresome, slow moving, unimaginative drivel.
It was OK seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around.
Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this.
I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic.
And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned.
Perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone's pants pocket."
2569_3	"Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud.
As a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.
<br /><br />A 3 out of 10.
Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type.
<br /><br />I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well, because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - CATCH-22, M.A.S.H., HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others).
You can't win them all!"
7866_2	"'The Hills Eyes II', one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time, is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest.
Or worst, however you choose to look at it.
While 2006's 'Hills' remake was one of the year's best, and truly frightening, horror films, this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment.
Part 2 never gets off the ground, and neither does its mind numbing dialogue.
Worst of all, it's not that scary.
<br /><br />2006's remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the New Mexico desert, deserted, and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people.
People who, as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago, have become who they are.
Surviving off travelers who wander into the region.
The sequel puts audiences in the same desert, now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family.
When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite, they find it deserted with no signs of life.
A grim reality soon befalls them, as they come to the realization that they're not alone.
And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.
<br /><br />It doesn't take a genius to realize that 'Hills' has no legitimate reason to exist.
But because last year's remake was received well both at the box office and by critics, it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there's still money to be earned.
There's no rhyme or reason to it this time around, just an unbelievable and ridiculous set-up to pave the way for thoughtless characters, unoriginal killings, a non-existent story, and slipping interest.
Originally, director Alexander Aja made Craven's cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience.
One that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions.
Its frank display of violence, sadistic torture, well-rounded characterization, and white-knuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences.
The second time around, it's rehashed hand-me-downs.
There's no style, no grit.
It tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies, when all it really does is make for a been there, done that kind film, where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths.
<br /><br />It's a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention.
It's a bore, nothing more.
'Hills' has no bite.
Despite a jump or two here and there, there's nothing very scary about this by-the-numbers horror flick.
It feels like something you'd see on the Sci-Fi channel, only with some F-bombs, a blood splatter here and there, a rape, and a graphic birth scene that's more gross than shocking.
It's cheap.
And with 'Hills', you reap what you sew.
With no effort given, you can't expect anything in return.
<br /><br />Replacing Aja with Martin Weisz as director was the film's first big mistake, all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance.
But even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by Wes Craven and his son, Jonathan Craven.
You ask, how bad could it possibly be? This is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like Shakespeare.
Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past, but I'd never expect something like this from him.
It's so unintentionally funny, you have to wonder, is Craven playing a joke on this? Or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off? The film's characters are one-dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense.
The acting is just as bad.
The only character who may win you over is 'Napoleon' Napoli, the scrawny kid who doesn't fit in with the others.
Even the deranged and instinct-driven villains, who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago, are met with indifferent.
You don't hate them, you don't like them.
You honestly couldn't care less.
Just like this movie.
<br /><br />Even if you were giddy with fear during 'The Hills Have Eyes', as I was, you'll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage.
It's as generic as generic gets, and there's absolutely nothing here we haven't seen done many times already.
I can't express this enough, avoid 'The Hills Have Eyes II' like the plague.
It's frightless, unoriginal, frantic, and a bore.
Stick to the remake or Craven's original vision.
Because if you don't walk out after the first thirty minutes, don't say I didn't warn you."
6982_4	"Damp telling of the American Revolution.
<br /><br />When farmer 'Tom Dobb' (Al Pacino) and his son arrive in New York Harbor, they are immediately conscripted by street urchin Annie Lennox...
Annie Lennox?...
to contribute to the war effort.
<br /><br />After getting chopped down by bits of chain-link fired from British cannons, Tom and his son are promptly chastised by Continental Army sympathizer 'Daisy' (Nastassja Kinski) for 'not standing their ground'.
Following this Kodak moment, a series of digressive chapters take place including Tom's participation in a 'foxhunt' in which he must carry a model of \poor old Georgie Washington\"" stuffed in effigy while running from a lace handkerchief-wielding English captain (Manning Redwood), and having a barbecue with a group of Iroquois Indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so Al and his ingrate kid can kick the crap out of British officer Donald Sutherland's butt.
<br /><br />Director Hugh Hudson presents a unique style of film-making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial London fog, but the scriptwriter's painting of the redcoats as evil monsters once again reveals Hollywood's patented hatred of the British.
<br /><br />Steven Berkoff appears as an enlisted American soldier."""
12404_1	"I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, I even wet myself a little.
When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time.
Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being.
Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past.
This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr.

1326_3	"Mindless dribble about the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking Sandra Locke.
You have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song \Suzanne\"" being played over and over throughout the movie until when \""The Second Coming of Suzanne\"" is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing.
<br /><br />This off-the-wall armature movie maker Logan,Jared Martin, is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project.
Planning to go on his own Logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ.
<br /><br />With Logan's assistant and all around gofer Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss,somehow getting a $740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece he starts to work on Suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film.
This leads to Suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist Simon, Paul Sand, but later Simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out.
<br /><br />The movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub-plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl Dorothy, Kari Avalos, who's cured of her autism by Suzanne after everyone else, at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to,failed.
It's not really known what exactly Suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she, like Jesus, could miraculously heal the sick?<br /><br />There's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical-like vision that changed his life forever.
Sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world, like this movie that he's in, and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on Suzanne.
Sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur David, Mark Rasmusser, who's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the Pacific Coast.
<br /><br />The movie \""The Second Coming of Suzanne\"" goes on with a number of unrelated sequences, probably to fill or pad in some time by it's director and film editor, and then goes to it's final scene in a Christ-like crucification on a hill as Logan has all the cameras rolling.
It turns out that the crazed Logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate, on the helpless and tied up Suzanne, the actual crucification of Jesus Christ some 2,000 years ago.
<br /><br />Hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow \""The Second Coming of Suzanne\"" puts you through the same kind torture that Suzanne is put through by Logan and the makers of the film.
The movie tries to be arty but that's just an excuse to cover up it's brainless and non-existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it."""

1439_3	"I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa.
The rest was...
well pretty boring.
For about 50min we have the outline of the plot...
In War of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real action! This is something like:\Let's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets!\"".
And maybe deliver a message, like \""Don't kill elephants!\"".
Very ecological.
I would have expected this out of a \""new\"" Steven Segal movie, not from this...
The leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty.
She just doesn't look like a 19 century woman! And in the bar, where they seek up our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula.
Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years.
Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880.
So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900..
Houston, we have a problem.
:) Swayze makes a nice impression..
as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside.
Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point.
He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions.

When Archie began to write his stories for the papers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert/absorb the First Nation Peoples.<br /><br />The film puts forward and asks the question; why would a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian?<br /><br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is.
Sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't it.<br /><br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the \""Cigar store Indian\"" a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done acting on the part of Mr.
Brosnan.
He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist.
The fullness and or reality of it weren't realized till he met and married his wife, Annie.

<br /><br /> This is the closest Archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype.
<br /><br /> Mr.
Brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors is both well done.
I have watched documentaries on Grey Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.

Well, until you meet the characters.
Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from down the street) brings the college co-eds a book full of witch's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house (where the movie takes place).
After that there is some drinking, fighting, and soft core porn.
Then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour.

821_3	"Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills.
THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task.
Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear.
Hackman asks a lot of questions that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere.
While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom.
The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it.
Kramer's direction is devoid of any style.
It's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad.
Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark's cruel lackey.
Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick.
One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife.
We're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang.
Kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig.
It's a role better suited for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell."

You won't be wrong!!!! With a script that sinks faster than a brick, clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them.

2050_2	"Not that \a film by Ulli Lommel\"" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations.
There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock.
But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid.
The effect is never perfect, but it helps.
Unfiltered digital video really only works for the \""mockumentary\"" style, because it never looks like anything other than video.
Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER.
Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer.
It does not feel like watching a movie.
And what's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker.
He ought to know better.
He ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video.
For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business.
And lucky us, he wrote the script too! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied.
Please, please miss this film.
You'll thank me later."""
1175_2	"Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background.
At times it works well, the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King's execution is particularly striking.
At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look, resembling a home video.
However, the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer.
We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters? To be frank, I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.
<br /><br />The other major failing, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role.
She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance.
OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion.
Her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by the debutante Helena Dubiel) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience.
Also, watch her hands when she is expressing emotion!<br /><br />All in all a very disappointing film, particularly given the positive reviews on this site."

This film does have some atmospheric moments, but about half the dialogue is hard to make out (sometimes it's poorly recorded, at other times just incomprehensible) and Orson Welles, who gets top billing, has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work.

I did not laugh once throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.
<br /><br />The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff.
Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff.
This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there's too much dialogue.
The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue.
At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, \That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,\"" possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book).
Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this.

Plan to return to it at 35.
Think you'll still like it?<br /><br />I don't think so."
178_3	"This movie was made-for-TV, so taking that into account, I'm not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film.
The script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not.
The acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.
<br /><br />The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video.
You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second.
I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.
<br /><br />Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it."
12040_4	"I know nothing of the Iliad so can not comment on it's accuracy to that story.
However, as a stand alone film I found this very boring.
The battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious CGI.
<br /><br />The acting is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt was cast just to attract the ladies.
But he does not make a good warrior, too pretty i am afraid.
<br /><br />Good points are is the design.
This film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings/walls impressive.
I do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely.
we hear American, Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation.
<br /><br />All in all, I do not recommend this film for a family sit down.
It is too long and the young will get bored.
<br /><br />For adults, it is OK if you don't care about the lack realism."

Episodes became predictable.
And main characters are not interesting.
Again we see a hyper-smart boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who don't understand their kid, and his friends: girl and fat boy.
Also this show has no logic.
A super-modern robot who works on two AA-size batteries, and can use a lot of weapons.
But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes.
We see two different robots, and it declines main idea of the show: \Robot must learn how to behave himself in human society\"""""
7125_3	"VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be something of a big disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with Robert Towne, it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik.
Firstly, top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He's not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one note performance lacks the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role.
Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one.
Also, second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home-made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star.
Mitch hasn't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one's mind his other Mexican revolution picture the far superior \Bandido\"" (1956) which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD.
Besides lacking any kind of style \""Villa Rides\"" also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory.
Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line.
<br /><br />There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect Panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune doesn't help matters.
<br /><br />As is Paramount's wont there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better."""
3337_2	"Casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and/or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on IMDb, one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge.
So eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself.
One of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie.
In this case the term \dark psychological thriller.\"" Read: \""hack writer/director who thinks he's an auteur, who replaces plot, story, and action, with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul.
His great insight? Festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults.
Wow, I bet Freud would be really impressed! Too many would be film makers like Kallio, who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades, fail to dig their own fresh grave.
Instead, they fall into the pre-dug graves of the many other directors that came before them.
They are content with rehashing old and tired horror clichés that they borrowed from a dozen or more films.
The result is an unoriginal, uninspired, unbelievable waste of film stock."""
1016_4	"The movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable.
What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one.
I have to admit I had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed.
The voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them.
Said to say, I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only.
Too bad I was wrong.
These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this a 4.
<br /><br />I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast...
and cannot believe it."
154_3	"Watched this on DVD in original language with English subs.
Either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development.
There are quite a few HK stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse.
It's just bad.
The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long.
If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot.
I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy."
12168_1	This movie was bad from the start.
The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high body count.
The acting was horrible.
The killings were acted out very badly.
Like when Ally got stuffed down that toilet I guess it was in the abandoned cabin.
But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see Ally so Angela must have gone in to get her.
The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and chocked her.
One it was horrible acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch?!?!? Then when Molly is getting chased by Angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her??? So stupid.
This movie sucked...
4934_4	"Warped take on the Pinocchio theme, and set during the Christmas season(..after the previous entry abandoned ties to Christmas) has booby-trapped toys sent to murder a child(..yet through this, other victims are accidentally harmed in the process)perhaps by a toy maker's \son\"".
Screaming Mad George was responsible for the killer toys(..including a larvae which enters a victim's mouth and out his eye, another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy, operating from a remote control).
The little target is a mute child named Derek(William Thorne)whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face, causing him to land on a fireplace poker.
Mother Sarah(Jane Higginson)worries about her son's mental state, figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or, more importantly, talking, derives from watching her husband's horrific murder.
Derek's real father, Noah(Tracy Fraim)fears for his son't safety, and informs, reluctantly, his ex-girlfriend Sarah that the local toymaker, Joe Petto(Mickey Rooney)once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash..
kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn't have a son, then others shouldn't either.
Still quite a heavy drinker(..often seen swigging Jack), Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids, but his creepy son Pino(Brian Bremer)hasn't and Derek he harbors angst towards.
Why? You'll soon understand.
<br /><br />Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise.
Rooney's name adds an allure to the film, gaining it a notoriety, but his histrionics can only help so much.
Attractive lead actress Higginson(Slaughterhouse)and Fraim as the man who re-enters her life aren't so bad, but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously.
I'm guessing that's the point, but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this..
he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation, quite volatile, barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino, when not downing liquor.
Bremer is appropriately weird and \""robotic\"" as Pino, longing to have Sarah as his mama.
The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing..
Screaming Mad George's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film.
The sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe(..
I can't even recall any nudity).
Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted, but that's not exactly an endorsement.
I'm pretty sure written on paper, this was an entertaining concept, the idea of spoofing Pinocchio using horror elements, but the result doesn't exactly blow you away."""
5981_3	"I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was not pleased.
<br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the story line needed a little touch-up.
Also, I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood, as well if it were rated PG-13.
<br /><br />That would definitely attract more people to see it-->teens.
What would also attract more teens (particularly teen girls), would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /><br />Even though the movie had it's down points, I still saw it and thought it was okay!"
5307_3	"What happened? 'Doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching.
The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar-nomination.
Though it was not one of her best performances, she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.
<br /><br />However, not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill.
From the boring start, which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending, the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers.
It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much talk and not enough action.
<br /><br />Furthermore, the other Oscar-nominations were less than convincing.
Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means Oscar-worthy.
(Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith, in Seven Pounds).
Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination.
Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain.
It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, as I am sure she would have walked away victorious.
Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.
<br /><br />Overall, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008.
It was a mess of a film with so much potential, and I do not recommend it.
The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep, who though gives a stunning, solid performance - doesn't even do enough to save this film.
*** / 10."
9024_4	"\Shinobi\"" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story.
Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence.
The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die.
<br /><br />OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Nope.
Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other.
They kill each other because the emperor says so.
Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions.
That's not stubbornness...
that's just plain dumb.
<br /><br />Fine, fine! There is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting.
At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, NO! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion).
I'm talking about things like, \""Lalala, I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*.
\"" THE END for that character.
Not even halfway through the film, I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it."""
11211_1	"There is so much that is wrong with this film, but to sum it up: Terrible acting- so bad it must have been on purpose.
poor script - they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story.
ridiculously bad ending- in some cases the ending manages to save the film-not in this case.
if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for.
This is the worst film i have seen in a long time.
It was complete torture sitting through this film, i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance.
So do yourself a favor.
Watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
Even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture."
2743_1	"I have to admit I did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching.
I watched it with a room full of kids, who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor.
The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that I grew up with.
THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR KIDS! Besides the fact that the content is so crude, the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it.
What a waste of a perfectly good story.
If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry.
Buy your kids the book instead."
8765_4	"I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day.
The quick summary of this movie is MUST AVOID.
JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well.
<br /><br />The movie tells the story of the attempt by Pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of Kashmir from India.
Supposedly based on fact, you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area from the Pakistani troops - who occupied the high ground.
But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story, all this movie does is make the Indian military look laughable and stupid, which I know is not true.
<br /><br />I watched this movie with an almost completely Indian audience, who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but also found themselves laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be funny.
<br /><br />The script was absolutely abysmal.
It gave the impression that Mr Dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference.
The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive.
<br /><br />The acting from most of the principals was not stellar, but considering the script they were given, I find it hard to criticise them too much.
As for the supporting cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs.
<br /><br />The editing was also pretty bad.
It was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time, and music would abruptly end at scene changes.
<br /><br />Good things: The cinematography was pretty good, although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour corrected (the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes).
Also, the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable - for the first half a dozen or so verses at least.
Unfortunately they went on a LOT longer than they should have.
<br /><br />And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG.
There is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 - 2 hour movie out of what was shot.
Sadly, a good editor was not working on this movie."
8537_4	"This movie got off to an interesting start.
Down the road however, the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals.

In comparison, this is \Boomerang\"" meets \""Extremities\""."""
9200_3	"One wonders how the script came to be written.
<br /><br />Wayne and the other performers do an OK job but as it is neither comedy, romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.
<br /><br />One feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile.
It is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the USA became directly involved with the war.
I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.
<br /><br />Nonetheless it has historical value."
9545_4	"Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the super government computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, tracks him because Will borrowed (by hacking) some money from his next door neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia.
The next door neighbor whose computer Will was fixing, has relatives in the mid-east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor's bank , and Ripley sees a terrorist connection.
Ripley has the power to call up missile strikes.
Oh, oh!<br /><br />This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s.
Well, the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days.
Makes sense.
So the movie dazzles us with fantastic CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, the forerunner to Ripley, is found operational, we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing, hoping, praying.sort of, oh-oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more cringing hoping things will go their way.
In other words we are now experiencing a made-for-TV type movie, and it's Oh Hum Time.
Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie.
It's much better.

3392_4	"What's with Indonesian musical movies? Never have I seen Indonesian musical movies like the ones made in Bollywood.
They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.
<br /><br />This story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks.
It's a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there.
<br /><br />Confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected.
The main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying.
As for the casting, I don't feel the necessity to put a Balinese student in that story and of course, that's not the only unnecessary characters.
<br /><br />The strange thing is, why would I want to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mangoes..."
7421_4	"Watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy.
So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.
<br /><br />There are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role.
She is dressed up as Grace Kelly, and she is not far off the mark.
Not at all.
But her character is not convincing.
The way she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life.
After all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue.
But the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run-off-the-mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters.
This is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the set design.
<br /><br />The finale in Central Station, New York is breath taking.
It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof.
The movie can be praised for its good use of architecture."
2533_4	"I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com).
The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.
<br /><br />I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 (usa).
Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing.
The story line was complicated, and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines.
At one point, I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film.
<br /><br />This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling, limbs severed, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character.
All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action, and won a great following without having to resort to effects.
<br /><br />I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend.
This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio.
I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films -- and recommend them."

The Reason, (which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want that it was made out of my head, I want that I watched ALL OF IT WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head.

I consider myself a HUGE zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting, lame \special effects\"" a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies, AS LONG as the film has a good atmosphere/story/suspension or whatever to offer.
This one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate, maybe worse.
Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week´s holiday and definitely did a better job (no zombie film though).

Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces), WAY TO MUCH fake blood (I like realism a lot, the combination of realism and Zombie films being debatable, but the presented gore is just plain silly).
The camera stays quite long with feedings scenes, it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder, why the zombies use WEAPONS (!) to kill their prey.

5428_4	"Another Priyadarshan/Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP rather than actual desire, the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.
<br /><br />I was happy with the casting in general except, Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys to no limit, he does however extract some laughs, but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol, I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great.
<br /><br />Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does.
<br /><br />This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced.
And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored.
<br /><br />The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating), the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on \MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA\"" (if you haven't watched it watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).
<br /><br />This movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act though, I've seen him in Main Meri Patni) who annoys more than entertains, I've said it many time and I'll say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies especially.
<br /><br />Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father, the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.
<br /><br />But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added, this mean that once the girl was in, the following 45-60 mins was increasingly torturous, the climax was \""SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY\"", I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.
<br /><br />The movie is also extremely predictable, there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here, its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.
<br /><br />The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.
<br /><br />Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition, THE LAST 10-15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE.
<br /><br />I didn't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in view of her non-appealing looks, if you cant be a HOT and cant act how much time can you survive.
<br /><br />Technically also this movie was weak, with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera-work.
<br /><br />The songs except the title track were no good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience.
<br /><br />In all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast, and the very low expectations.
<br /><br />Avoiding it wont be a bad idea.
<br /><br />And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.
<br /><br />-s lots of stale jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY, bad technically, bad songs.
<br /><br />+/-s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier for it), Tanushree Datta.
<br /><br />+s some good scenes towards the beginning,title song, good acting and cast except RY.
<br /><br />total 4.5/10 (I'm trying to be objective here, i don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations, so I'm giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4)"""
4926_4	"I saw this movie for 2 reasons--I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer.
Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie.
I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because it does explain his disdain for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been.
I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists.
I actually enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself."
7228_2	"The Good:<br /><br />Effective color scheme.
Good costumes.
Top notch set production.
Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles.
<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Horrible mixture of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy.
The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago.
Flawed logic.
A giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it, no one really even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out, nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate Jill?<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />Awful script.
So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized.
The dialog was almost laughable at some points.
Random characters and events that are not needed.
Dull characters.
Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer.
There is nothing to her.
She is uninteresting and boring to watch.
She has no substance, no texture.
Her character has no redeeming qualities.
In fact, there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose, any goals (besides the obvious one of Horus), any motivation.
They are weak and ill-conceived.
There are no stakes - the key to screen writing.
Horus will not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy.
One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character.
That is the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character, never brings one to fruition.
They are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces.
First time director pacing.
Slow, slow, slow.
I am still watching the movie as I write this.
I cannot pay attention because it is boring.
Everything is flat.
Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary.
<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Not worth a watch.
Threadbare story, sub-par character development, corny CGI does not save the nice set production."

Not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed.
The ghostly nightmare begins...Pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity.It's obviously influenced by \Carnival of Souls\"".
The cinematography is decent,unfortunately there is zero suspense.
4 out of 10-just another instantly forgettable teeny-bopper trash."""
8586_3	"What a disappointment...
admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly.
There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years.
I won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is Star Wars...
the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm.
The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades.
Utterly disappointing."
11223_1	"I watched the movie, and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience.
The language would put to shame the street loafers.
<br /><br />The plot; a father forcing none of his son to marry, seems far-fetched.
<br /><br />The idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded's attention.

5953_1	"How has this piece of crap stayed on TV this long? It's terrible.
It makes me want to shoot someone.
It's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie.
I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense.
I remember watching it when it first came out.
I thought, hey this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was.
It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table.

And he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go.
The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion.
Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas."
3045_3	"Believe it or don't, i have my very own DVD copy of this \movie\"" which i bought at Walgreens for a great big whole dollar.
I'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.
<br /><br />Pretty amazing set designs and costumes.
Apparently much thought and effort went into their making.
The set designs are very Mexican in stylization.
I liked them a lot.
And Santa is impressive.
One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom.
<br /><br />I'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience.
But, somehow, it comes across quite deranged.
In fact, i'm left stunned at how deranged it is.
<br /><br />Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre.
One of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness.
The kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very, very weird.
<br /><br />Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? You didn't? Neither did i until i watched this movie.
One learns something new everyday.
<br /><br />Is this movie actually worth watching? Now, that's a tossup.
I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way.
Yet, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching.
You decide what you're going to do.
I dunno...
for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves.
Now, that's just wrong..."""
7995_3	"I remember watching this movie when I was young, but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies I find it and think to myself \that is the title?\"" This movie is a kind of combination disaster film/insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it.
It is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such.
The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants.
I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that.
The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too.
What else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through.
In the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants."""
7740_3	"This film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey.
Sadly, the film ends up being too 'confused.'
While I know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films I got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and I lost interest.
<br /><br />The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on.
We formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering.
<br /><br />In the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism.
Here's what's concerning Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film:<br /><br />1.
His real estate deals 2.
His affair with a radio psychic 3.
He's being investigated by internal affairs 4.
The homicide investigation<br /><br />If you add in Casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death.
Now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen.
The impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking.
<br /><br />As if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, wasn't bad enough, Joe Gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun.
All these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught.
We already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension.
<br /><br />While I could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, I won't.
This could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time.
Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is worth noting.
Sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable.
<br /><br />While this will probably be better than the likes of \The Hulk\"" and \""Lara Croft II\"" that still doesn't make this film good.
I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money, I'm not sure if that's true or not.
What is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor, this film has neither in its lead roles.
My advice to Harrison Ford would be: to stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run."""
6206_1	"Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong types.
That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect.
<br /><br />Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs.
The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if, like it's director, it has no where better to go.
We are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do.
Robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist.
<br /><br />The film is really about Clay's total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts.
Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs.
yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence.
Is this guy for real?<br /><br />If Clay has not seen YouTube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film? All anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and I am sure that will be what sticks with people.
<br /><br />The rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film Clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status.
<br /><br />Shame on all involved."
6858_2	"John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined.
From the utterly terrible acting performances (and don't you, \Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it\"" me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting.
I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience.
But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable.
Right down to it's end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shined and resonated.
The actors portraying the \""southern\"" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather.
The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities.
O'Connor's powerful book is most well-known for it's creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of \""Faith\"".
Mr.
Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so.
While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan.
If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr.
Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash.
For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston.
The forgetting....that will take some time."""
2395_4	"Could this be by the same director as Don't Look Now or Bad Timing? Poorly<br /><br />acted, clunkily edited.
You only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in Don't Look Now to see how much Roeg has lost his<br /><br />touch.
<br /><br />Even the generally reliable Teresa Russell (looking a bit chunky these days, I'm afraid to report) cannot save this one.
The plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wooden and Roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful.
<br /><br />Avoid this one like the plague."
1069_3	"I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival.
Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but I didn't.
It stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential).
The director is Matt Bissonnette, who's married to Molly Parker.
All three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third.
It all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful.
The film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and I thought it needed to be the other way around."
6569_3	"Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland.
Be amazed as Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.
<br /><br />Why is WoF set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, The Road Warrior was! Actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the Road Warrior! Except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's The Time Machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non-vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.
<br /><br />In typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion.
Inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them.
Along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film.
Generally I waited for Trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated.
Badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker.
The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.
<br /><br />Rats: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior.
And that in and of itself is saying a lot! By this count 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire.
A poor Road Warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.
<br /><br />"
1296_3	"**SPOILERS**This was an ugly movie, and I'm sorry that I watched it.
Like Jan Kounen's Dobermann, it suffers mostly from poor editing--or lack of it.
It is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention, he added all of the footage he had shot together.
There are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie.
One of them is *SPOILER* when Benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him.
That was cool--but okay, we got it! Move on please! The camera won't stop spinning around this guy! There's maybe one or two more cool scenes that I forgot about in this flood of mediocrity, but the last duel scene IS NOT ONE OF THEM! It may be because unlike in the earlier sword-handling scenes, Shanao isn't masked--but just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled Asano Tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80% of the sword fight with extreme close-ups of sword clashes! And all from the same angle, may I add.
The director should learn from the American produced 1995 bullet-train ninja movie The Hunted! I personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years.
The situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the Japanese media, due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority.
The movie versions of GTO and Salary Man Kintaro are two other recent examples *END SPOILER* I don't understand.
I just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this.
Maybe the worst was lost in the translation.
<br /><br />The ending of the movie--on which marketing played a lot, is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between Shanao and Benkei.
But that legend is not the most popular in Japanese folklore, and it is so detached from contemporary themes, that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques, who cares how the director wants to re-interpret the story!? Director Sasaki Hirohisa of Crazy Lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new Japanese directors to ignore Japanese audiences, and target their movies for foreign film festivals--in order to gain faster international fame.
This works, although it doesn't make sense, because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries-what kind of movies people WATCH in those countries.
Certainly not Gojoe and the like."
11812_1	"...however I am not one of them.
Caro Diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess.
Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but doesn't want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really doesn't want to either.
A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film.
At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside, but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them.
Interposed with Moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period).
We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come.
I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again.
He succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity."
11153_2	"Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story.
Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense.
The only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film, so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things.
Low budget films can't afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive, but were at least a valid attempt.
The creature suit is terrible, as seen when it falls to the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots.
The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator.
The last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip-off from Terminator, with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf doesn't smash into.
In the end, the girl calls the hero \a good Protector\"", but he gets both his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun.
But here's the real clincher for bad writing: They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes.
Instead, they took it into custody?!?"""
11468_3	"I don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd.
Orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to be...its silly.
Orcas are extremely intelligent, don't get me wrong, but I highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge.
So I have to say all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was.
So I was at least somewhat amused by it.
Personally, I'd recommend going and seeing Jaws if you're wanting to see an Animal-Killing-Humans type of movie.
But if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then I'd say go ahead.

8154_3	"The long list of \big\"" names in this flick (including the ubiquitous John Mills) didn't bowl me over to the extent that I couldn't judge the film on its actual merits.
It is FULL of stereotypes, caricatures, and standard, set scenes, from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer.
The music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the film was over: loud, rising crescendo, grand flourish and finish then silence, but then the movie continued! I found no real storyline, haphazard writing, but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons (pre-nose job) with a rousing little ditty.
I cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great.
I found it maudlin, mawkish and minor."""

That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination.
It was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter.
I was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with Sands' acting was quite enjoyable.
However, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.

8932_2	"I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970.
It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films, and this only deepened an interest, as I just had to see what made this movie so bad.Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers.
Although I will say it does make for curious viewing, the acting, direction, and script are so laughingly bad, that the supposed satire is completely missing.
Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation, the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone.
John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he licks and leers at the screen, he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there.
Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene.
Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role.
But , of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west.
The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film.
I don't mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film, no one comes out looking good.
The direction seems so unassured and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but boring as well.
Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected.
To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this, and I was glad I at least saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning."
1443_4	"Start of with the good bit: several times Swayze talks Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes.
That's a great plus, as normally USA & UK movie audiences think all people on this planet speak English (just in case you're one of them: no they don't).
<br /><br />But the acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in The Netherlands (it makes your toes curl -and not in a good way).
I like Swayze but in this he's awful.
The muscles in his jaws make overtime and he's frowning the whole movie -some one must have told him it looks butch.
No Patrick: it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character.
Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co-workers.
Her acting is só relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days.
And it's not.
Your frock was a clue, Alison.
<br /><br />The best acting came from the people from the African Continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa I liked best.
Clear, warm and in character, his performance is a joy to watch.

1527_1	"If you really, truly want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /><br />1) Look through the TV listings.
2) Find the movie 'Men in White'.
3) When 'Men in White' comes on, sit and watch.
<br /><br />And that's it.
After sitting through two hours of bad puns, dreadful (and not that funny) movie references, and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history, you will have wasted two hours of your life, and wonder exactly why.
<br /><br />Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good.
It wasn't.
<br /><br />But, on the other hand, if you're old enough to remember Power Rangers, you might spot some familiar faces during the film.
Presumably to save on production costs, Saban (who also make Power Rangers), decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone's favourite tacky toy-spawning franchise throughout the film.
I spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes I saw from when I was a kid, so I guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value.
<br /><br />But, if you want to see actual Power Rangers monsters, go watch Power Rangers itself.
It's much better than this piece of garbage.

<br /><br />Although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring.
I think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new.
It's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P.
Diddy and Prince present a category.
Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more appealing.
None of it really worked out.
<br /><br />Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter.
I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories.
His presence wasn't really as 'big' as for instance Billy Crystal's.
<br /><br />Also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times.
Not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird.
<br /><br />Still, I can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners.
None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case.
So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? I don't think so.
I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, with the exception of \Million Dollar Baby\"" and \""The Passion of the Christ\"" maybe.
Sure I don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I don't like Robert Richardson's work, he really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone's work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more.
Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music.
But oh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that.
There will always be people complaining about the winners.
<br /><br />It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners.
Did Prince said any of the nominees names right at once? And were is Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy \""I hope they missed\"" Irons were the best presenters of the night.
<br /><br />Overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners.

7961_4	"Five years after the original Creepshow, another inferior horror sequel is penned by George A.
Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2.
This time there are only three stories instead of five.
None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either.
The first story is a horror staple, formulaic story about a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners.
The effects are really neat in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough.
George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners.
The second story, \The Raft\"", is a Stephen King story.
It's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake.
Soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason.
However, instead of being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next.
There is also some unintentional humor in this segment.
The third and final story is \""The Hitch-hiker\"", which is actually a retread re-adapted for Creepshow 2.
The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film.
Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens.
\""The Hitch-hiker\"" works the best out of these three offerings, but it's not without its problems either.
Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitch-hiker, or so she thinks.
However, we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her.
As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns.
The wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place.
Tom Savini appears as the \""creep\"" in this installment.
The good thing is there haven't been any more sequels.

The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect....
I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story.

6002_1	"\Sundown:The Vampire in Retreat\"" is a rubbish.The acting is terrible,the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are uninteresting.
The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the IMDb users gave it a 10.
This is really horrifying.
No gore,no suspense,no violence,nothing
Bruce Cambell(\""The Evil Dead\"",\""Intruder\"")is completely wasted,the supporting cast is also terrible.
Yes,some people may like this picture,especially a mainstream society but hard-core horror fans or gore-hounds won't enjoy this piece of crap.
Personally I hate horror comedies,I prefer watching serious horror movies like \""Cannibal Holocaust\"" or \""Last House on the Left\"".
In my opinion,a real horror movie is supposed to be scary,excessively bloody and disturbing,without stupid humour,which usually ruins the whole concept.
This one isn't scary,isn't gory,isn't even funny as a comedy,so don't waste your precious time."""

This garbage make Plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material."
11693_4	"A fun concept, but poorly executed.
Except for the fairly good makeup effects, there's really not much to it.
There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days...
and once he's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.
<br /><br />In any case, the movie has far worse problems than that--the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-TV-show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around.
Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch...
the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse
br /><br />The only reason why I'm giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegna's character takes over, the movie develops a fun, campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feel, and the gangster's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch.
The ending, if predictable, is also nicely mean.
Avoid unless you're a King-o-Phile or are REALLY psyched up at the idea of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp."
2240_4	"The \saucy\"" misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s.
There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese.
The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik).
There's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore).
<br /><br />Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case.
The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her.
These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué).
The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that \""Chinese birds are inscrutable, ain't they?!\"" The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations.
The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about.
<br /><br />Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks."""
11542_2	"An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho thugs during a night-time encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England.
The man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers...
<br /><br />Utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash, somehow masquerading as 'thought-provoking' drama, whilst actually coming across as sub-Michael Winner cr*p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s).
What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is appalling and devastating, yet Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness.
His camera lingers hungrily on Anderson's naked body both during and after the assault, whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional cliché.
His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces (Adams's attempted post-incident assaults on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide-attempt confession).
<br /><br />The quandary comes from the central protagonists' performances - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault (he'll end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary.
Even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways, she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate.
<br /><br />A vile and pointless film then, almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance."
7499_3	"John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a New York Latino, able to get inside a myriad of characters, both male and female, to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture.

<br /><br />While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (I won't spoil that), Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in.
It's her performance that elevates this movie.

The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution.
It was completely unoriginal.
O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors.
If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off.
Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.

11861_4	"Just saw a pre-screening tonight.
What can I say? It lived up to it's mediocre trailer run, though that's saying nothing at all.
It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn't done, and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humorless movie play out.
<br /><br />So let's see...
we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he's not good enough for her, check.
We have the three buddies that all have their own \personality\"" with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything 24/7 and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney), and the third guy whose name you won't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen...
check.
We have the girl's ex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side...
check.
We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check.
We have the movie's \""funny\"" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down or being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos...
check.
And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie...
check.<br /><br />Honestly, this could have...
no, wait...
should have been a PG-13 movie.
All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs.
Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up.
The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn't fit in with what general people look for.
I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera.
Let's put it this way...
in the theater, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing.
When this movie hits Showtime and you're checking it out at 2:00 PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel.
The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve's hotness (who is not quite a 10, but still very good looking).
<br /><br />Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window.
So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be \""feel-good\"" with the abruptness.
<br /><br />There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack.
Aside from the nice choice of 90's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose.
I'll give them props for a great choice of sound.
<br /><br />One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion.
I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it.
But I say hold onto your money.
If this was PG-13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I'd say knock yourselves out.
Otherwise, definitely pass.
It doesn't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely isn't as good."""

There is the government conspiracy angle, the crusader protagonist who has personal experience...

There isn't a shambling corpse in sight, and it's terribly light in the gore department.
\""Zombie 3\"", on the other hand, is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore, it is better than \""Gone With the Wind\"".
It is also not overrated.

As usual for a Fulci flick, the acting is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful.
Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature.
It is badly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat.

Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost icy.
Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend.

She throws a chain at the guy and ow! it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him! That was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion.
Or a few moments before that scene, when she finds out that the couple is gone with Bill, ridiculous.
She hears them plan their stuff, and like 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 of them are gone, and without any struggle or noise or anything!<br /><br />I mean the idea of the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires co-existing with human in our modern society...
but honestly I don't think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show, that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about...
Unfortunately, the script is written poorly, mediocre at best.
It's shallow and extremely predictable.
Often I thought that this was some kind of a joke or something.
<br /><br />The actors deliver really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion.
They seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were some kind of a regular, low budget family TV show (well maybe thats what it is, if you take away the family part).
The only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, considering the poorly written, extremely short replies he had to say \""What are you...\"" \""Can I give you a call sometime...\"", I think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have, actually.
Anna Paquin was okay as well, but not more.
But the guy, playing her brother though, jeez, he's horrible.
The scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television.
The acting is bad, the construction site looks fake to the bone, and the two other guys \""Why is he getting arrested? Uh..
I dunno...\"" That was pretty embarrassing.
<br /><br />Another thing that I think was completely missed was the way they presented Sookie's psychic powers.
They make us hear what people think AND speak both at the same time and thats just wrong.
Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel, and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think.
<br /><br />And finally, the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting.

The movie poses some moral questions \""Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?\"" and more poignantly for Australians \""Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal?\"" The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable.
And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike \""Picnic at Hanging Rock\"".
<br /><br />If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a let down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element of mystery.
And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale."""
5887_3	"Jane Russell proved to be a delightful musical-comedy performer in the similarly titled \Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\"" but, sadly, this film squanders those skills.
There is a budget, and nice Paris photography, but the film just doesn't work.
Ms.
Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe.
That leaves nobody to adequately play Jane Russell.
Some of the other players are WAY out of their element.
<br /><br />There are several embarrassing scenes; most of all, be warned: there is a musical number where boneheaded African cannibals \""cook\"" the brunettes in a pot, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit.

330_1	"I wanted to punch the TV.
Watching it was torture.
I hated it.
Never watch this movie.
The terrorists are annoying.
Adam Sandler is annoying.
I normally like him but not in this one.
I wanted to break the DVD.
This is the most irritating film in the world.
The comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious.
The only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls.
It was so irritating I wanted to punch the TV.
DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOY SOMEONE.
If you even like Adam Sandler a little bit, Don't buy it.
It will just make you hate him.
Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it.
Its a waste of the $1.99 I paid for it."
7918_3	"I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible
br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well.
For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie.
<br /><br />Dina Meyer was pretty as always but I found her role pretty bland so I don't think one can say that her acting was great.
<br /><br />As for the male lead, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series.
<br /><br />All of that I could have lived with.
However the terrible, terrible, terrible end/solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing I have seen in a long time."
7458_3	"Admittedly, I didn't have high expectations of \Corky Romano.
\"" But then again, who did? However, I felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt.
I had no high hopes of \""Joe Dirt\"" either--another recent comedy starring an SNL cast member--and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.
But this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews.
Chris Kattan is actually a talented comic actor--contrary to what you might think after watching this movie--with great energy.
He's been in many hilarious SNL skits, and I think he's one of the most talented cast members on SNL as of now.
In this case, he's given a lame, pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging.
Throughout each scene, he attempts a lame Jerry Lewis act and fails miserably.
Jerry Lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy, not to mention he worked with much better writing.
Kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with ADHD who had one too many Cafe Lattes.
He doesn't even wait for the punchline; he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack.
In one scene, he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth.
The package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him.
He comes back to the job, strung out on coke.
Now, how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on-edge, when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film? <br /><br />As for the rest of the cast members...Vanessa Shaw is really hot, Peter Berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is Chris Penn.
Peter Falk is also wasted, though he has a few funny lines that I'm pretty sure he improvised.
I hope Falk gets a decent movie someday soon.
That's too much talent too waste on a clunker like \""Corky Romano.\"" I didn't like Falk's last movie \""Made\"" all that much either, but at least he had a decent role.
<br /><br />I chuckled a few times, but I could not get a single laugh.
Each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery.
And it's made worse by Kattan's hammy acting.
And there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out.
For example, when Kattan is about to fart in his two brothers' faces.
He stands there for 2 or 3 minutes, trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one.
It's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out, but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse.
And another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two Asian men are saying during a drug bust.
I can go on and on about what's wrong with this so-called comedy, but I'm not gonna waste my time.
Like I said earlier, if you predicted bad things from the trailers--you predicted right.
<br /><br />My score: 3 (out of 10)"""
7476_4	"Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this.Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to.I lost count of the amount of times a major Hollywood film was quoted most notably James Camerons Aliens.The amount of blood and gore on show here isn't funny either,the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out.Maybe it would have worked better as a short film.The actors a poor,the direction is weak and the plot is non existent.I can see what the director was trying to do,the homage he was trying to pay,but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here.

6743_1	"How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream-ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure.
For one thing the dialogue is poorly developed, it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details, the acting is bad, et cetera.
I want my money back, this rental stinks worse than a skunk."
7288_2	"NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good.
This movie is incredibly long.
However not good.
The scenes were drawn out way, way, way, way, way too long.
The sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long.
The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas it became so boringly long that I can only give it a 2 of 10.
It is way below average.
<br /><br />Some other problems also exist in this marathon.
<br /><br />1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree.
The guy who played the Great-grandfather looks nothing like him, but the Grandfather, Father and the son (who gives us constant unneeded voice over) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality.
No one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last, even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn.
This one is minor, but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying.
<br /><br />2) The fact that no news from Germany was even whispered for the longest time about Jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous.
Some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed.
The uncle in France would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.
<br /><br />3) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong.
You are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short.
Suddenly...
people are in love and almost instantly...
married.
Then having children.
Then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships.
This again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us.
<br /><br />4) The ending was just bad.
I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but you won't like it either...unless you are sadistic.
<br /><br />The director/writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis, I mean endless loop, oops they are the same thing.
<br /><br />I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie, I mean I think Istvan Szabo must be modeling his directing career after him.
Long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie.
A short description of 'The Horse Whisperer', and Sunshine.
<br /><br />Sunshine, perfect title.
If you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave."
353_4	"As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour.
However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in.
Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality.
And the ending is simply bizarre.
The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud \dramatic\"" score.
Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable.
If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see, otherwise skip it."""
479_3	"Wow, the plot for this film is all over the place! There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! And, as a result, none of it seemed particularly believable.
<br /><br />The movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town.
She's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway.
When a big-time actor arrives in town, she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost.
But, her husband is worried about shenanigans--as this actor is a cad.
So, the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor--and the actor dies! As a result, he's convicted of First Degree Murder!!! Not Manslaughter, but Murder 1! Now, pregnant and in need of funds, Kay goes to New York.
But Broadway jobs aren't to be found, so she's forced to take any job--even Burlesque.
Unable to adequately care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise.
However, eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy.
But, the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play.
Despondent, she makes her way to England and becomes a real star.
Years later, she returns to New York to get her kid--but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother.
At the same time, her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $10,000 he can get the man out of prison.
As another reviewer wrote, is this to bribe people?! How can $10,000 get him out otherwise--maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! Wow--this is enough for 2 or 3 films! And, all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! Believe it or not, there's quite a bit more to it.
If you really care, see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.
<br /><br />This is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping, somehow, it will all work.
Unfortunately, the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms.
Francis' best efforts.
It's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd-rate plot.
It's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements, threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! Overall, unless you are a die-hard Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood made in the 1930s, this one is one you can easily skip.
Not terrible but certainly not good.
<br /><br />By the way, the child who plays Francis' daughter upon her return to New York (Sybil Jason) really was terrible.
I think she was supposed to be...I think."

First they just have to learn some ninja skill, because \only ninja can beat the ninja.

The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it: Same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising, even in the ending scene, which by itself reduced movie's (trash)value.
<br /><br />Even 80's ninja-flick-fan, who understands the esthetic of trash-movies, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable.
It simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer, neither in visual level nor in plot.
Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging, but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes.
<br /><br />It's hard to recommend movie to anyone.
Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in \""Enter the Ninja\"" falls behind Sakura killer's American-ninjas.
Even in visual level movie doesn't have any balls and it's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie: There isn't any.

9322_1	"Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you.
And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this isn't it.
Usually I will go for stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid it almost (or possibly did) make me stupid.
<br /><br />The film quality is better than a handheld, but not by much, and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard.
These problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing (weep) cast, and you have a real humdinger.
<br /><br />The story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend.
He also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office.
On the way there they meet a female in distress, who is then invited to come along by the other girls.
<br /><br />The stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.
<br /><br />From there you (the audience) and the morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another.
Overall I think I have made it sound better than it is.
The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot contrived, the acting bad and the motivations clueless.
Once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas, it is not.
<br /><br />The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway.
Please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie.

10485_1	"Darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman, with odd ties to Elvis Presley, running into a sea of Elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in Nevada...and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own.
Kim Basinger, a still-attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to pick quirky movies to play in, but this dreadful screenplay (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) hasn't an iota of good humor.
The stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy, but even on a shambling, shameful level, the picture is crude and sloppy.
If you do watch, see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of Basinger behind the wheel of her pink Cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face.
Hopefully both she and Elvis were well paid.

Keeping with tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines, the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture.

3944_3	"The film My Name is Modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty Blaise novel called Night of the Morningstar.
It describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, mid twenties in the film)asserts her leadership in a war over a casino.
As this is set before the actual Blaise adventures her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the film.
That is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip.
The other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay.
The casting is okay but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young Modesty.
I get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise."

I actually couldn't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping (cat litter being more appealing than this film).

And don't even get me started on the plot.
You will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible.
The rampant ego of Streisand, thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to Oscar heights, led to this disaster.
I'm pretty sure the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this film and never forgave Streisand.
I can't blame him.

<br /><br />The only reason I was able to watch to the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene.
In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look.

The aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills.

<br /><br />Second of all, I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music.
They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close-minded - in fact, I don't recall the quote exactly, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, \Why do they have to be so uptight...so classical?\"" It's really insulting how label classical music in this way.<br /><br />Third, I've went over it dozens of times, but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears.
there just isn't any point at all.
<br /><br />And oh yeah, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it wasn't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting.
She was oversupporting the whole time.
<br /><br />1/10 stars."""
7656_1	"Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing-games of all time.
I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen, trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in.
Now, mind you - I am weary of \computer-game-generated\"" movies.
I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be watchable.
And yet, I am such a big fan of the game that I couldn't resist.
My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's, it would be OK.
<br /><br />Man, those were 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that I'll never get back.
If I had that chance, I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead.
This isn't even in the \""so bad it's funny\"" category.
You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb.
Now, Tara Reid...
I'm not complaining about her presence.
However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene, - which I totally understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body on press conferences.<br /><br />There is no plot to speak of.
Won't waste your time pitching it to you.
The credibility of the story sinks below 'I did not have sex with Ms.
Lewinski'.
The acting is but a few notches above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend OVER this one.
<br /><br />Kids, I recommend the Video Game.
It has far better story, acting and much more thrills.
As for the movie, here's a spoiler - it STINKS! Wait for the porno version."""
90_4	":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy.
I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark.
I love the first three \Love\"" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be.
The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context.
I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit.
It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion.
There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.
<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book.
It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings.
I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it.
And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.
<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite.
I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland.
I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next."""
4741_3	"Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie.
I am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much.
I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem entertaining to younger children.
The matrix moves ruined the action, you know that it was absolutely fake.
Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which Wendy was striving to win.
It all ends like a typical feel good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end.
So Wendy learns a lesson...blah, blah, blah.

12386_1	"It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age.
This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film.
I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth, Iwill never forget it.
I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made.
I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified.
<br /><br />I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie.

In his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy, that is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr.

9798_4	"15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially that of the youth.
When I was a 3-year-old kid living in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there).
When the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe to me when I watched it with my dad and 2 uncles.
My grandparents even sent me a \Balikbayan\"" box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the Rangers).
I even played the video games, and loved only one of them (\""MMPR: Fighting Edition\""), which was REALLY sad.
Anyway, it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like \""Gundam\"") Now that I'm 18, I'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now.
To prove this, I took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set DVD collection with \""MMPR: The Movie\"" and \""Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie\"" and watched both of them.
I was like, \""Ugh.
How awful.
Just another junk in the attic for me.
\"" For all of you people of my generation, this is NOT a show that you'd want to watch over and over again.
I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally is not a bad thing now, is it? Instead of \""Power Rangers\"", I'd recommend something like \""Mobile Fighter G Gundam\"" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), \""Ninja Senshi Tobikage\"" (aka Ninja Robots), or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of \""Power Rangers.\"""""
9660_4	"When this movie was first shown on television I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I as experienced by American soldiers.
Unfortunately this is not it.
<br /><br />It should have been a good movie about WWI.
Even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props.
But the writing and directing are badly lacking, even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies.
War movie clichés abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men.
When will Hollywood realize that, even though there have been plenty of bad generals, most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences? The first part of this movie appeared to be \Paths of Glory\"" with American uniforms.
Except that \""Paths of Glory\"" was emotionally gripping.
Later on there was Chamberlain's charge (except uphill) from \""Gettysburg\"" and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from \""The Thin Red Line\"".
But in \""The Thin Red Line\"" the soldier was alone when captured.
In this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle.
<br /><br />If this movie used a military adviser they ignored him.
Even though the actors (and I never could forget they were actors while watching) mouthed military tactics I didn't see very much of it.
The American soldiers would stand up to be shot while the Germans attacked.
And the infamous Storm Troopers, who were apparently blind, appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack.
In the real war, the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective.
But the silliest scene was the attack of the German Flamethrowers.
In this scene the German flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending Americans.
If that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defender's bullets.
<br /><br />Okay, so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown.
But it is still disappointing.
But what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti-war anti-military angle that movie makers seem to think is important.
True, war is hell.
But most American soldiers, even though they grumble and gripe, tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung-ho about it.
My Grandfather served in World War I.
And even though he died four years before I was born I have been told how proud he was of his service."""
7825_1	"I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.
<br /><br />After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the even-crummy-looking-for-their-time futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film.
<br /><br />Then there is some more murky stuff.
Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield.
Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints.
<br /><br />Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky close-ups of an old lady as she dies.
We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned.
Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he is not human.
Also, he probably doesn't like humans either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth's population.
<br /><br />After a while, Clark Kent shows up back at his old job (I forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened).
Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops.
It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.
<br /><br />At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle.
It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television.
Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event.
There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit.
The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.
<br /><br />As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build, I excused myself to get a soda.
I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety.
I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row.
Then it was time to stop messing around.
<br /><br />I walked back into the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us.
Still, it seemed to be taking forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him off to college.
While attending my son's medical school graduation, I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns, so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry.
It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane.
When they did, Superman saved everybody, which was pretty cool.
<br /><br />.
And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing.
Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops, who seems like a good guy.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie.
I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent.
I hope he wins the million dollars.
<br /><br />At this point, things start to gear up for the big murky finale.
I think maybe the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here.
I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, back to the murky things, he's sick again, no wait, he's okay again.
<br /><br />Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move: yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.
<br /><br />Then Superman died and came back to life.
I thought the movie was over, so I left.
<br /><br />Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly.
I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and I went to retrieve it.
When I did, I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns wasn't over yet.
I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.
<br /><br />I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while.
Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave.
<br /><br />So that is my review of Superman Returns.
<br /><br />Oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you will love this movie.
On account of there are two jokes like that in it."

Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserably.

Certainly it reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968), and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which deal with loss, grief and relationships between parents and 'lost' children (curiously both films star Mia Farrow).

It's just a mess.
Grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions, leaving loose ends flapping all over the place.
It was as if Tobe Hooper had been taking David Lynch pills.
Unfortunately he didn't take enough."
5885_1	"to make up a movie-going audience - I'm certainly stunned by the number of positive comments this wretched film has garnered here.
I can't credit it, can't help but be suspicious, for that matter, of back alley payoffs to critics who are touting Annette Bening for an Oscar; the hole in the kitchen ceiling might be more appropriately attributed to her scenery chewing.
She's a wonderful actress but this is an unfortunately unbalanced performance, lacking that essential quality film actors must master of catching the cadence of the screenplay and maintaining it for the duration of the disjointed madness that is a film shoot.
<br /><br />I don't really want to blame Miss Bening or most of the other performers (well, Gwyneth Paltrow has no excuse for her muzzy work), however, because this is a horrendous adaptation, a classic case of mistranslation (I am prepared to assume.
I haven't read the book and don't think I will after this).
The script launches us into the middle/muddle of unaccountable behaviour and extreme emotional angst spewing from mystifying characters who have developed relationships neither with us nor each other.
It quickly becomes a grotesquely excessive tsunami-like assault that sullies characters and audience alike and left me like a survivor shaking my head at the detritus left at the end of each repetitive episode.
Shock and awe would describe my reaction to frantic, bi-polar mood swings between ranting and oh-so-quiet sensitivity, the latter telegraphed by one of the most irritating, manipulative, droning soundtracks I've heard - that is, when all this isn't being set to ludicrously incongruous toons - period stuff, ya know, but chosen with an astounding disregard for the tone of the scenes.
<br /><br />How this fine cast got mixed up in this I don't know - I can't believe they saw the screenplay before signing.
They certainly apply their skills with commitment - I felt so sorry for the wonderful Jill Clayburgh saddled with a cartoon bag lady costume and wig trying vainly to wrench something of significance from sketchy and clichéd dialogue.
In contrast, somehow, Alec Baldwin rises above the material to deliver a consistent, nuanced, real performance.
Can somebody give this man a lead role of substance, please? And how about Rachel Evan Wood - or Joseph Fiennes? You'd think the industry could make better use of him, and without appearing as hirsute as Elliot Gould in M.A.S.H.

1152_3	"I understand what this movie was trying to portray.
How the old are often ignored and treated like a bother, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty.

I enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self-consciously arty (as in this case) the result is often frustrating.
Including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience.
<br /><br />The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together.
This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its' merits but I was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else.
It might have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies (for example: 'Notting Hill') but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching."

Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction.
James just really ticked me off for more than half the film.
The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.

5023_3	"Nobody, but nobody, could chew the scenery like the Divine One, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and \Elizabeth and Essex\"" is a great example why.
Although she overplays the part at times, watch her when she gawfs about Raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies-in-waiting are about to play: in that one moment, she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely! At other times, she is done in by the script's sappiness.
When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she comes off as weak and shrewish.
This has the added effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice, it's hard to take her seriously.
<br /><br />Flynn exudes charm, making us see how Essex was able to worm his way into Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man.
It also doesn't help that Essex is badly underwritten.
Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his Queen - even as he swears fidelity to her - except only that he is more blue-blooded, thus, more \""worthy\"" of rule? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex's letters? He's in no risk of falling out of favor, and we know where Essex (and his head) is headed.
So why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable?<br /><br />What did Curtiz do with all the $$$ he was given? He doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage.
He should've ended it with Elizabeth the first time alone at The Tower; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary.
The costumes are fantastic.

2098_3	"I was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensationalising voice-over in the worst tradition of TV production.
<br /><br />If you could cut out the voice-over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great - but I feel I've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme.

8323_3	"From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws.
The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and he is struggling to both fill his father's shoes and cut the apron strings mother (and co-executive) keeps too tight.
He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry.
There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle class girl (Jessica Alba).
Uncreative story lines, but not bad enough to ruin the movie.
The only real \oy vey!\"" moment was the name of Lena Olin's character.
Overbearing woman named Lilith...subtle!<br /><br />The surgical scenes are not at all censored.
I appreciated that, people who find surgery scenes scary might not.
The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first.
You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader.
The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.
<br /><br />The big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he, like us, initially missed.
<br /><br />There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother.
One is an impressive gesture by Olin, which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing.
The other is a secret about the family's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless.

3403_3	"This film should have been fun.
A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix...
and Terry O'Quinn.
In space.
But it dragged on, had unlovable characters and had no target audience.
<br /><br />Some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs (named, appropriately, Jinx).
The space scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view.
Adults will be bored and cheesed out, kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it.
<br /><br />There is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle -- this never takes off.
Why it is included in the first place is unclear, except maybe to add extra tension between the characters - but it failed if that was the idea.
<br /><br />A young Lea Thompson should be quirky and attractive, right? I mean, \Back to the Future\"" is great.
But no, she was irritating and average-looking.
Not someone you'd want to date, have as a friend or even consider as a role model.
Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance.
Maybe he can act like Mikey in the Life Cereal commercials, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy.

To be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents.

The action was awkward and stilted.
The dialog was inane.

In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well.

<br /><br />The process of the song's development, from Mick Jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar, to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end, is fascinating, and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the Stones.

Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, the ones from former Soviet Union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what Americans have been working for.
Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it.
That's the main thing.
Another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs.

1359_2	"A good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy.
Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable.
Regardless of the favorable comments here, this film is awful.
Badly directed.
Badly edited.
Badly acted.
Badly written.
You need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad.
<br /><br />The muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns Ustinov conning his way into an American insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds.
How he does it is beyond lameness and credibility (he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets, and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Morley into going to South America and stealing his identity).
<br /><br />As a side plot, Ustinov romances fellow loner Maggie Smith, who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building.
She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that go nowhere, while Ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden.
Then he Marries Smith and they fly off to Brazil, which has become the staple finale of almost every British caper comedy since (Nuns on the Run? A Fish Called Wanda?)<br /><br />The surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before.
By the end I was thinking I must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this.

6647_2	"A drama at its very core, \Anna\"" displays that genuine truth that all actors age, and sometimes, fade away.
Anna is a character that believes America is her safety net, her home, and it can do her no wrong  but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in.
She is hard-nosed, optimistic, stubborn, and arrogant when it comes to her life, yet not afraid to let others in, yet drop them at a moments notice.
Anna flip-flops between personalities, which makes this film ideal of an aging star, but not idea of the viewing audience.
\""Anna\"" has been praised for its star Sally Kirkland, and her ability to get \""grungy\"" for the role, but a month into 2008, \""Anna\"" does not remain a staple of film culture.
It is dated, dull, and formulaically chaotic.
<br /><br />Director Yurek Bogayevicz has a message hidden within \""Anna\"" about the falsehoods of Czechoslovakia, both politically and socially, but Kirkland refuses to let them upstage her.
Bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera, to use wooden frames to allow Kirkland to stand out, and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film, it is Kirkland you remember.
If it isn't obvious, this film didn't sit well with me.
From the opening of the first act and deep within the second, \""Anna\"" felt like a high school theater production.
The characters were non-existent, there was no enlightening pre-story, and there was no definition of time or place.
There was Sally Kirkland, stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants.
Randomly she encounters a friend, a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to America for the glitz and glamour, and two of them (within the span of 20 minutes) build a friendship that could break all walls.
It is emotionally boring and unbelievable.
Again, randomly, we meet Anna's boyfriend Daniel (played by the weak Robert Fields), who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character  only to boost the attention onto Kirkland's Anna.
Through the course of nearly two hours, we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads  and SALLY KIRKLAND.
Arg, it pains me to continue to say this but \""Anna\"" could have been a fantastic film had Bogayevicz presented equal time between Anna, Daniel, and Krystina, but instead we are forced into a one-sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot.
<br /><br />Is this where Charlize Theron found inspiration for her beauty-less role in \""Monster\"", or Halle Berry in \""Monster's Ball\""? Was Sally Kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character Oscar will shine in their direction? Throughout this film I was disgusted by Kirkland's portrayal of Anna, and Bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent.
Bogayevicz gives us an Anna that doesn't work hard for her parts, doesn't care for others, and is generally mean spirited  yet we are to feel sympathy for her? Near the beginning of the film, she forces what she wants to do onto others, and gets upset when she doesn't get her way.
Sure, aging actresses my have that appeal to them, but Kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one.
That is where \""Anna\"" could have improved.
If this was a mature Kirkland, I would have gobbled it up, but this stammering childish Anna was impossible to believe.
While my favorite scene was near the end where Anna goes to watch one of her older films playing (included is absurd make-out characters) and the film burns, this scene is also one of my least favorite.
Anna has made a phenomenal life for herself, creating films and building the dream, yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight, she gets jealous and outraged.
This didn't make for a character I wanted to stand behind nor win Oscars.
Coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer, the outrageous over-the top wardrobe, and the displaced ending (where did that come from and what happened??)  \""Anna\"" slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema.
It was a show-piece, an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time.
In this one it worked, but I don't think I will be fooled again.
<br /><br />Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with this film.
\""Anna\"" is not a film about an aging film star; it is about Sally Kirkland, and ONLY Sally Kirkland.
Bogayevicz tries to do more with the story, but fails either because Kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story.
There are one or two decent scenes in this film, but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential.
Bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe, tear up for, or dedicate a Sunday afternoon with  he created an annoyance.
Kirkland wasn't Anna, she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides.
Perhaps I missed the scope of this film, but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved.
That wasn't the case here.
In \""Anna\"", Kirkland orders Daniel to act like a dog (apparently as a symbolic act) and yet during the entire emotional scene, I couldn't help but think that was what Kirkland was like to those on the set.
She didn't make this into a film, she transformed it into her own production, and because of it \""Anna\"" failed.
I cannot suggest this to anyone  from one Czech to another  skip it! <br /><br />Grade: * ½ out of ***** (for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out)"""

All you gotta do is ask God and he'll give you anything....
puh-lease.
Thats not true at all, duh.
I laughed several times because of this embarrassment.

<br /><br />I got another one like that: -The dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline-<br /><br />This movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making I have seen in a long time.
It starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise.
But alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction.
And it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts.
<br /><br />Pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut.
With enough booze in my brain I would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree.
I have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story.
And they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.
<br /><br />And that's all jolly swell.
But at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story.
And apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like \Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle.
And we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it's a blatant robbery.
<br /><br />What ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed.
If this movie was a roller-coaster ride, you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off.
There are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it.
Nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going, you get pulled in yet another one.
<br /><br />I guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next David Lynch or something.
<br /><br />1/10 for totally violating one's own work (Ritchy: seek professional help).

11059_4	"\Dahmer\"" is an interesting film although I wouldn't use \""horror\"" or \""thriller\"" do describe it.
It's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer.
<br /><br />Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims.
The film centers on the relationship between Dahmer and \""Rodney\"", well-played by Artel Kayàru.
<br /><br />Rodney is almost the more interesting character: enamored of Dahmer and having once escaped an attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack.
<br /><br />I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer's formative years, how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims.
<br /><br />The roles are well played but the story is thin."""

There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts.

The plot takes way too long to get off the ground, never steadies itself, and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film.
There are a few gem moments for zombie fans, but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror.
<br /><br />The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance.
First, there's a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs.
The hero of the movie is an ex-Vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob.
The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail.
In this jail, they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior.
But the badie psychotic head scientist/military guy has other plans in mind.
He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make ....da da da....
super soldiers! After some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine, the military/crazy scientist guy goes \hey this might be a problem\"" and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra-empowered independent woman character, who of course invented the original serum.
She goes to the prison to see what's going down, the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison, and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out.
The hero guy and the scientist/journalist lady team up to find a cure, save the warden's kids, and deal with some irate prisoners, both infected and not.
Meanwhile, the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother.
The military gets ready to blow the place up, and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out.
<br /><br />There are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars.
There's also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner.
Still, the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film, when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner.
<br /><br />The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end.
The hero, woman, and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route.
Their path leads them to a long hallway, on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars.
Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through, gracing their hair and faces as they pass by.
There's also a few good scenes of the classic \""couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies\"" and \""many zombies ripping one guy to shreds\"" bits.
<br /><br />Overall, worth watching if you're researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichés worth noting; it's practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie.

alas, this film was not what I was looking for.
I had hoped for the best, but instead, was delivered a boring Nordic soap-opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time.
The film's premise is intriguing enough: It's about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker.
This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane, and violent lifetime after lifetime.
The movie is filmed competently enough, with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end.
The filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique but they dropped the ball.
Perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore...
I mean, we are talking about \Berserkers\"" here, aren't we? Vikings were supposed to be BAD enough, what with all the raping and pillaging, so aren't Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme?

Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and, although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute.

Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day.
The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard.

8251_3	"Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this a double entendre about the star?) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day.
And it works for that for that purpose: being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.
<br /><br />The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice.
His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship.
Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs.
On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed 'Anonymous' as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity.
At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not.
Both have ex post facto regrets.
Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and is indeed cheating on Alice.
Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as 'Anonymous' to test his fidelity.
The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise (of sorts) of the fluffy script.
<br /><br />British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting.
Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved.
But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages.
One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive.
There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor, but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise.
Grady Harp"
4247_4	"A painfully protracted, maudlin and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet film, Garbo Talks, gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest.
<br /><br />The film documents a harried young working man named Gilbert (Ron Silver), who is son to Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, feisty and above all, an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo.
When Estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor, her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own: track down Greta Garbo, and bring her to his mother.
<br /><br />Anne Bancroft is in full-on, chew-the-scenery Auntie-Mame mode here, that kind of feisty ol' gal that film loves, where she mouths off to people, and stands up for her ideals, and ends up in jail all the time.
She stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct, and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame; every note striking false.
The rest of the characters are equally as one-dimensional, but tremendously less-interesting.
Ron Silver is flat as can be, and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film: He is dating affluent Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but becomes smitten with oddball co-worker Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and I called every scene three scenes before they happen.
<br /><br />That's the other problem.
One-dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story, but there's simply nothing here.
The film's pace is glacial, resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing, and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot, it's both plodding and uninteresting.
There are plenty of guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (imagine that) in yet another highly inessential scene.
<br /><br />Late in the film, it attempts to make a halfway-decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time, none of the characters exist as real people, and the film had bored me into submission, so it functions as a case of far-too-little, far-too-late.
The film is my twenty-fifth Lumet-directed film, making him easily my most-viewed director, but outside of a couple egregious misses (A Stranger Among Us, anyone?), he hasn't plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks.

6761_2	"Let's be honest.
As a film school project, made without budget and \real\"" actors, this is a passably interesting film.
As something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a very poorly produced product.
If I would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally, it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while.
As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would be getting a proper cinematic product, i.e.
a film, I feel deeply disappointed.
It's a videotaped TV play, something along the line of old sixties serials, but without that certain charm.
Aside from the leading man Mr Redfield (who also is the director), the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus (a bit too old for that actually), or members of the director's household, who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches, but also the make-up artist or hairdresser (a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s).
It's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds.
Synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame \""period\"" inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion.
The film attempts to be \""dreamlike\"", whereas in fact it's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing (and believe me, the standards weren't too high to start with).
There are interesting dialogs every now and then, but overall it's pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew.
That's how \""artsy\"" films attempted to look in the 80s.
Mr Redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director."""
8749_1	"A terrible movie as everyone has said.
What made me laugh was the cameo appearance by Scott McNealy, giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos.
McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft.
They have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft.
So, were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire?<br /><br />There's no public record I see of SUN's involvement, but clearly the makers of this movie know Scott McNealy.
An interesting mystery."

<br /><br />\The Grinch\"" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion).
Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying.
I used to like him very much in his \""Waynes World\"" and \""So I Married an Axe Murderer\"" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and \""the Cat In The Hat\"" has just finished me off.
<br /><br />This film was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was \""Mom\"".
They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for Myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the Cat.
<br /><br />I mean - did Myers even glance at a script? Was one written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the Cat just seemed to be winging it!<br /><br />On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!! But unfortunately they cant save this film.

4187_3	"A film written and directed by Neil Young, \Greendale\"" is little more than an 87-minute music video set to a doxen or so of the songwriter's works.
In lieu of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's lyrics, which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary, to tell the \""story\"" while actors act out the scenes.
<br /><br />Given the hammy performances and the shoddy graininess of the picture, the effect is the equivalent of Young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption.
Although there is allegedly a \""story\"" running through the film, we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting.
All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent narrative while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack.
The whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self-indulgence.
\""Greendale\"" gives off-Hollywood, low budget movie-making a bad name."""
6393_4	"I will admit that I did not give this movie much of a chance.
I decided pretty early on that this just wasn't my kind of movie.
<br /><br />For the most part, it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography.
The scenes of early 70's Manhattan look very good, as does the lead actress.
It is a very crisp black and white, which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh.
However, some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell.
The disjointed editing is VERY late-60's, somewhere between surrealism and new wave.
The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation.
<br /><br />The film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with.
As she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs.
The movie seems to be meant as an off-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel.
I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book.
<br /><br />Some problems I had: Near the end of the movie, one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes-brutal to sit through.
Also, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found gross and juvenile that serves as the film's climax.
I did laugh out loud four or five times, and I liked the ending (minus the flat-out disgusting animation).
And when the film switched to color for the final phone-booth-at-night sequence, I actually liked the way it looked even better.
It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt like I could have really liked it if it been a little different.
But this is what the filmmakers gave us.
It is obscure, artsy, and way left of the dial, but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own.
I didn't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious."
3016_1	"I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott films.
When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'.
To find out that the movie it's the furthest thing from it! The story was treading water from the get go, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea.
And the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous! <br /><br />The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.
<br /><br />I like Tony Scott's direction 'n all, but this takes the whole friggin cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!"
1901_1	"This review may contain some spoilers.
<br /><br />The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well.
Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well.
But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable.
For those who don't know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors.
Who would suspect them.
But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B.
Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great.
The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase.
Where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes.
My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase film, fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake."
2088_1	"What an awful show.
Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality.
It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off.
This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show.
The acting is juvenile and uninspired.
The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series.
The story is bad.
The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera.
The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful.
Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort.
This is one spin off that should have never been made."
6067_1	"SLIGHT SPOILERS (but it doesn't matter anyway).
<br /><br />An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines I need to put these remarks on the netwaves.
This is the single worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct Mystery Science Theatre treatment.
Even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very lame mess.
Its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are put to use.
Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master.
Period.
And no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that.
Oddly, Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director, but at least such films as 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).
<br /><br />Abominable acting.
Camera angles stuck in cement.
Tensionless rhythm.
Yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course JC cannot really be blamed for (unless the writers were buddies of Cody.) The initial two minute slo-mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be Scully-Mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film.
But come on, a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez-vous with the fender of a pair of 'women's rights' MDs whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner.
Oh, and I won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds.
Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.
<br /><br />Then things fall apart real quick.
The vacuous dialogue \I just want to help you\"", the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of cell phones?) followed by the the shoot-out: a born-again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at Easter break.
Another lovely line: \""So what are we going to do?\"" from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van.
Er, no it isn't yet pheasant season.
So who needs those teen boys anyway.
What about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all-American SUV?<br /><br />As for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves, the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comics strip.
All that was lacking were the Wham, Bam, and Whiz of the balloon titles.
And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode.
<br /><br />At one point we learn that Daddy isn't really the daddy, but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either.
This story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins.
Yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are actually ever found together.
They remain mere abstractions to each other throughout.
<br /><br />With the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable.
Bland, hysterical, dull-headed, macho.
As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be.
None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them.
And there's that bickering Dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend.
He fortunately got his.
There are two great MST-worthy comic moments: the gusher when Angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby's head.
Also cute was Angelica's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right-to-life little monster from Hell.
As for that audacious male abortion scene...well, they should have retained Miike's episode and banned this one instead.
<br /><br />In short, a 3rd rate Rosemary's Baby meets Alien set on the turf of a M.A.S.H.
episode.
This stinker alone, appreciable only to today's permissive under-16 generation, will assure as someone else said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season.
A real shame, since there have been a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs as Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee's deliciously quirky 'Sick Girl'.
Not to mention the superb imagery of Malone's 'Fairhaired Child'.
<br /><br />Sorry John Carpenter, I believe your directing days are over.
It's time to run for President."""

Anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry, hermit type personality.

Before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio \""knew best\"" and how \""no one will take such a film seriously\"".
I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him), and had higher hopes than what we got.
<br /><br />The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing 'camp' was the only way.
Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could.
At the end of the little event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better.
<br /><br />STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise...if it hadn't been for the flacks.
<br /><br />Tear out the memory or history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.
<br /><br />But destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.
<br /><br />Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero.
<br /><br />SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's a lot more serious.
Yes, there was simultaneous footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors.

Ely's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words \""DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL...

10842_4	"Noting the cast, I recently watched this movie on TCM, hoping for an under-appreciated gem, as I regard many films from the 30's.
This is no gem - not even semi-precious.
The anachronistic clothing and 1930's Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately.
The casting is strange, also.
But mostly, there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices.
This film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise, but the components aren't mixed according to the right recipe.
It simply doesn't come together like it should.
And that's a shame.
WIth a few rather obvious, but minor alterations, this might have been a very good movie.
<br /><br />The film is about an American showgirl (Jean Harlow) seeking a rich British husband - preferably from the nobility.
She meets Franchot Tone and his buddy, who are on a lark in a Rolls Royce owned by his buddy's employer.
Harlow mistakenly assumes Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she sets her sights on him.
This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction.
<br /><br />However, Tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a German 5th columnist on the eve of WWI, and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart.
Tone and Harlow are married, but just as the honeymoon begins, he is gunned down by a Mata Hari-type (Benita Hume), and Harlow flees the scene, with a bystander accusing her of Tone's murder.
(In fact, Tone recovers from the wounds.
)<br /><br />Harlow flees to France, where she falls in love again - this time with a wealthy French cad (Cary Grant).
Tone, now in the army, and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in Grant's hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash.
In the following scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold-digger.
Harlow never explains about the witness' accusing her of murder and her panic! That is one of those unreal, movie-plot-device break-downs in the story.
<br /><br />Then Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him.
She is on hand to watch her paramour, Grant, test the new plane that Tone has delivered to him from England.
Incredibly, both Hume and Tone dimly recognize each other, but simply can't place where from! Okay, so Tone was shot and almost died; perhaps his memory is a little out of whack.
But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks? (She does not seem to be faking the memory lapse.
)<br /><br />This is inexplicable and unnecessary.
Hume should have absolutely recognized him, but played it coy when she realized that Tone wasn't able to place her.
That would have been a much better treatment of that issue.
<br /><br />The finale also is very unsatisfying.
The movie, as made, has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad, Grant, leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero.
Then Harlow and Tone just walk away.
It is noble to preserve the French public's perception of their national war hero, but very unsatisfying as a love story!<br /><br />What the film begs for is this: Harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder; Tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her; he then carries a torch for her, even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve Grant's reputation.
Meanwhile, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad he is.
Then having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is, Harlow rekindles feelings for him, too.
At film's end, the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of Grant's death.
After Grant's hero's burial, we see them embrace and kiss at the fade-out.
That would have made a nice little movie.
For Cary Grant fans, it would have been even better had Tone played the French cad who is killed and Grant the long-suffering first husband, reunited with Harlow.
<br /><br />It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as the Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant is cast as the Frenchman.
This movie would have been much better had they reversed roles.
That also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been..."
5494_3	"<br /><br />Cheap-looking and ugly, this film didn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience, except for one fairly amusing toilet joke.
Christopher Lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role, although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help.
  Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role.
Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation.
There is really no reason to make this movie, especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with Robin Williams's often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy.

Honest this is the plot of the movie.
He try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body.
For some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin.
The sleaze style of the movie is laughable.
No one in the movie can actually act including the head.
The closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell.
The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so badly done.

the movie has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes....though the animation is top notch.
<br /><br />Once the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage, but it was never unique.
This same plot has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies...
The writer could have done so much more with the entire concept, but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started.
<br /><br />Overall, too much hype but not able to deliver."
4658_1	"BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic, which was based on Noel Coward's play \Still Life\"".
A doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married social worker of Italian ancestry.
They meet by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday.
The pair fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part.
Coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love.
Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people'.
Loren in particular is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as a part-time voluntary social worker at a Citizen Advice Bureau just doesn't ring true.
Burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, doesn't come across as your average General Practitioner.
That said, you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses.
Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt.
Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous.
Their final scene together will induce nausea, (\""You've been a long, long way away\"", etc.).
That great British jobbing actor, John LeMesurier, has a three minute cameo as Burton's friend, and appears to be slightly inebriated, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice.
It's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal, awful rehash of a cinema classic.
Avoid at all costs."""
4959_3	"Remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90's? The one that people praised? The one that people of all ages could all appreciate? The one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the Hulk in a bat suit? The one that had villains you could relate to? The one that had villains with real motives?<br /><br />Well clearly, Warner Bros.
doesn't.
Hence this dreck.
<br /><br />Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have they even looked at a batman comic before? Do they know Batman's meant to be a 'detective'? Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!<br /><br />This is the basic layout for an episode:<br /><br />Penguin steals something.
'Opening credits'.
Batman finds dead giveaway of where he is.
Batman goes there and get's into trouble.
Commercial.
Batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it.
Penguin escapes.
Penguin does something obvious again.
Batman follows.
They do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and i mean EVERYONE know's kung-fu for some reason).
Batman punch's penguin.
he get's knocked out.
goes to arkham.
(Note: it's usually a different villain every episode)<br /><br />Well as you may have noticed from that, Batman's not a great detective.
\Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's at the old amusement park\""! Yeah maybe, he was there the last 6 times.
<br /><br />And I've already mentioned this but, EVERYONE KNOWS KUNG-FU! EVEN PENGUIN! what where they thinking? (probably because it's from the people who made that Jackie Chan animated series)<br /><br />What's really upsetting is that the show is just action.
No smarts.
None.
If batman needs think, he'll use technology, then do some kung-fu.
<br /><br />But hey, let's not forget the villains.
Afterall, what would batman be without his rogues gallery?<br /><br />Well first off, I gotta say, kudos for originality.
I don't think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread-locked monkey man, riddler like an emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think about, isn't her sexuality meant to be her main strength?)<br /><br />What's even more crap however is that, every character is now a 2-Dimensional, stereotypical crook.
<br /><br />E.G.
<br /><br />Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason.
<br /><br />Man-Bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason.
<br /><br />Penguin just wants to steal everything.
For no reason.<br /><br />noticing a pattern here?<br /><br />But the most insulting has got to be Mr Freeze.
<br /><br />Do you remember the Emmy award winning 'Heart of Ice' episode from Batman: The Animated Series? The one that gave Mr Freeze motives for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story (mad scientist)? The one that made him a victim, with a goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin acknowledged that, using that as Mr Freezes origin in that P.O.S.
movie.
<br /><br />Well this series says \""F#ck that\"" and makes Mr Freeze a jewelry robber before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold.
He then continues to steal jewels for no reason, while saying sh!t lines like \""Have an ice day\"".
<br /><br />Maybe they did watch Batman &Robin after all.
<br /><br />But hey, look on the bright side.
This series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that you're a good person.
Good for you."""
11314_1	"This movie is probably the worst I have seen.
Bad acting, bad script, bad everything.
Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting.
Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well!<br /><br />The story is not original.
The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances.
A special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story...
The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there \prophecy\"" and the humans need someone to stop them.
One girl together with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.<br /><br />In this movie the director tries some Hong-Kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far.
The movie fails miserably in this attempt.<br /><br />I recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new \""worst ever\"" movie to relate to.
And to fans of the genre I recommend \""Cyborg\"" since I think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor.
And if you can't stand Van Damme then check out \""Nemesis\"".
<br /><br />I rated this movie 1/10."""
5285_3	"Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen, one should simply read them.
I agree with that.
However, we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike brings to mind that without good writers, it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life.
The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation.
This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade & kissing in the street scene in Bath).
The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems angst-ridden.
The other characters were not very developed which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements.
The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about, and Mrs.
Smith, Anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in Bath - - twittering away, as many of the characters seemed to do.
The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which caused Anne to love him in the first place, didn't seem to be written into the Rupert Penry-Jones' Wentworth.
Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look, than P-J was able to do with his poses.
All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment.
It seemed to reduce the novel into a hand- wringing, costumed melodrama of debatable worth.
If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare: adapt it to the present.
At least \Bride & Prejudice\"" was taken out of the historical & locational settings and was fun to watch, as was \""Clueless\"".
This wasn't PERSUASION, but they didn't know what else to call it."""
8630_4	"I know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact, after we had been given a very negative opinion of Jin from seeing Sun's flashbacks in \House of the Rising Sun\"", we get to see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life.
<br /><br />But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode.
Before now, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had been hinted that Sun's father was someone who was getting rich through shady, illegal methods.
I thought maybe he was a mob boss, even; mobs operate in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility.
However, in this episode we learn that Sun's father is in fact the boss (or a top executive) of a Korean automotive company, and that what Jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official (who was actually going to be murdered) on his behalf.
<br /><br />I may be especially touchy about this because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in Korea; that huge, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model for this fictitious car company, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these mafia-like methods, instead of like any normal automotive company of the West.
it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story, and that there hasn't been an uproar in Korea over it.
It feels like extraneous \""Buy American!\"" propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy, third-world outfits."""

The memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years.
I didn't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day- sentiment confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent, indecipherable, and uninspiring.
A little research reveals that the producer was star Leslie Caron's husband, thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film.
The film's roster of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame, and James Sikking among others - suggests that it holds some promise.
But the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay.
The \mystery\"" implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene.
The movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller, but never settles upon one or the other.
The sense of suspense is entirely absent.
The main characters settle on playing dry, emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever.
The cinematography is pedestrian.
The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and, in the end, the film itself.
I am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase.
I hope that if TCM finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4:00 am slot."""

It's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures.
For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots.
However, what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are.
This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy.
The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is.
Come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults.
Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least."

Gore & his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of \An Inconvenient Truth.\"" So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at \""An Inconvenient Truth\"" & discover the main fundamental flaw.
While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed \""global Warming\"" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it.
For example: I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right.
BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is \""getting warmer\"" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it?

Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a \""New Ice Age\"".
The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity & El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed \""Global Warming.\"" Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer: It's wishful thinking, Mr.
Gore & you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced \""An Inconvenient Truth\"" were really honest, they would have titled their film \""Al Gore Wants Attention.\"" But what I'd really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters (AKA China & India) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords?

That's what made the original zombie classics good.
The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra.
We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's.

8078_2	"The world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the Sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart: yes, it's Solar Crisis, aka Crisis 2050, which burned up a huge chunk of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a Happy Meal for each of the cast in Japan before going straight to video (remember them?) in a re-edited version credited to one Alan Smithee.
The plot hook's pretty much the same as Sunshine - suicide mission to the Sun, saboteur on board, logic cast adrift - except that this time they're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach Earth.
With a talking bomb.
Voiced by Paul Williams.
Who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously Given that the cast also includes Jack Palance at his most dementedly OTT, Charlton Heston at his most rigid, top-liner Tim Matheson at his most anonymous, the original Hills Have Eyes' unforgettable Michael Berryman (you may not remember the name, but you DO remember that face) and Peter Boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because, er, if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down, you'd expect if not a laugh-a-minute at least a laugh every reel.
No joy.
This is the worst kind of bad movie: a boring one.
The fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace.
There's low-key and there's walking through it, but here the cast don't even do that.
Instead, they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time.
You keep on hoping for Paul Williams' talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis, but instead the film just...
stands there, doing next to nothing.
Literally.
This is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if Clive Owen had been cast, he'd almost have looked lively by comparison.
Even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves, yep, the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness.
Even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world.
Merchant-Ivory films have better action scenes.<br /><br />Things aren't much livelier down on Earth where the movie spends most of it's running time with Matheson's son/Chuck's grandson Corin Nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with Palance's insane desert artist \looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me\"" while waylaid by rejects from a Mad Max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can release him on a nice beach.
Just don't expect logic, if you haven't already guessed that much.
Best moment? A ditzy girl in a bar describing Jack Palance as \""An old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather,\"" though Chucky Baby taking out the villain's aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99% of it's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin'.
Richard C.
Sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in Japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes: the director of Vanishing Point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re-edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film.

Guess what the plots about? Zombies taking over.
This time though, for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in Rhode Island, and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island.
A TV station, controlled by the government, is supposedly keeping up \normal\"" broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world, that is, those that never look or go outside, anyway.

3923_2	"With the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with HB Warner on the celestial train, this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness! The acting was atrocious, but the story is what I really found appalling.
The acting was wooden and stilted, even by early talkies standards (the exceptions being Lee Tracy and HB Warner, neither of whom can do wrong).
Rose Hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as Julie (as she likewise was in 1932's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, an otherwise excellent flick).
And the rest of the cast was worse, there being no words to describe their awfulness.
<br /><br />Worse than the acting, however, was the story.
For some unknown reason, Julie loves Liliom, a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
He marries Julie but doesn't support her, instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal (Lee Tracy).
And, oh yeah, he never has a kind word to say to Julie and he regularly beats her.
Julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him, which only seems to make him more abusive.
What's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story.
Somehow we are supposed to see Julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems Liliom.
WTF? <br /><br />The last 1/3 of this movie takes place after Liliom has killed himself (a robbery plot goes awry and Liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police).
As he lay dying, he tells Julie \I beat you all the time, but I'm not sorry for it.\"" When he at last dies, she finally tells him she loves him.
(Neither character ever said \""I love you\"" to the other while they were alive.) After his death, God's Chief Magistrate gives Liliom one more day on earth so that he can \""do something good\"" for his unborn daughter.
The price for this is 10 years in hell.
After 10 years, Liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter.
He approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him \""do something good\"" for her; he tries to get her to play cards, he tries to give her Gabriel's horn, but she's not interested and rebuffs him.
So he slaps her.
He.
Slaps.
Her.
And then he disappears back to the afterlife.
Looking on, we see his daughter tell Julie about this.
The girl says the slap didn't hurt, that it felt like a kiss.
This is supposed to be the movie's magical moment.
The girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible, and Julie replies that \""someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all.\"" Then the music swells and Liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train.
BLECH! <br /><br />There was one saving grace to this film, and that is the interview between the Chief Magistrate (HB Warner was truly magnificent here) and Liliom on the celestial train.
The Magistrate had some very profound things to say to Liliom about life and second chances and death.
This scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars.
Regarding Liliom's suicide as a means for escaping his problems, the Magistrate says \""People suppose that when they die, their difficulties are ended for them.
You thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities.
It is not as simple as that.
On Earth your name is still spoken; your face is still remembered.
As long as one is left who remembers you, so long is the matter unended.
Until you have been completely forgotten, you will not be finished with the Earth, even though you are dead.\"" Some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash I've ever seen.
<br /><br />By the way, this story has apparently been filmed many times both as \""Liliom\"" and as the musical \""Carousel.\"""""
4149_1	"Dear me.
Where do I start? The dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad.
He corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film.
The favoured exclamation in this film is \Jesus Christ!!!\"".
Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between.
Motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist.
People 'rush' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH.
The world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days.
Breasts appear for the sake of breasts.
Normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity.
There's a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach.
The General and his catchphrase of \""Shut the f**k up!\"" is the only redeeming feature.
As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves."""
1391_4	"Before this made for TV movie began, I had relatively low expectations.
That's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone.
There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta.
If you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left B-5 permanently.
Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance.
But because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped.<br /><br />The movie is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane).
A lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless.
Yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly I felt like it was a case of \been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past\"".<br /><br />The secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit.
This was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking.<br /><br />By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter--with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery.
However, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character.
This should have been spotted and corrected.<br /><br />So the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard B-5 nuts (like myself).
Others seeing it might assume the series sucked--which is a great injustice.
This is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit."""
8204_4	"An unoriginal, overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci-fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something, and in of all places (surprise, surprise) Antarctica!<br /><br />The film features James Spader and an almost nameless supporting cast (with the exception of Carl Lewis, who's actually not that bad for a non-actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances that do little to invigorate the script's unimaginative dialogue.
To make things worse the film's pace is slow, there's almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting.
Its little wonder that this thing went straight to DVD.
What is a wonder is why Spader - an excellent actor at times, who won the Cannes Best Actor award for `Sex, Lies and Videotape', and did a splendid job in the innovative sci-fi flick `Stargate' - chose to sign onto this lackluster project.
Or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.<br /><br />The most remarkable thing about `Alien Hunter' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci-fi films, and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived.
There are huge borrowed bits from `The Thing' (both Howard Hawks' original and John Carpenter's excellent 1982 remake), `Contact' and `Outbreak'; a few hints of `Alien', CE3K', `The Andromeda Strain', `Kubrick's `2001' (i.e.
the `alien black box') and `Mission To Mars' (i.e.
the mystery message); and even a little dash of `Sneakers' and `A Remarkable Mind' (although not sci-fi films, they share a `cryptology' connection).
Hell, there's even cornfields and Antarctica, just like the recent `X Files Movie'.
And the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from `The Abyss'.<br /><br />Its all been done before and done a whole lot better, although I will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end.
I could say a little bit more about the plot, but there's absolutely no need.
You already know over half this movie without ever seeing it.
