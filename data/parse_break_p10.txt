1310_7	"**SPOILERS** Highly charge police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of Riverside Wisconsin.
Who's being tracked down by the local police using policewoman Gina Pulasky, Helen Hunt,as an undercover decoy to catch him.
<br /><br />Nothing new in this made for TV movie that you haven't seen before but the depth of the acting and screenplay is unusually good and brings out a lot about not only the killer but the policewoman's, as well as her fellow policeman lover, state of mind.
<br /><br />Having been put under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable assailant, who attacked her partner with a rifle.
Officer Palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect Kayle Timler, Steven Webber.
After he was positively identified by the little girl Sahsa, Kim Kluznick,who saw him not far from where little Timmy Curtis was found stabbed, 18 times, to death the next day.
<br /><br />Getting a job at the Mr.
\C\"" Diner where Tim works Gina gets to become very friendly with him and later tells him, in order to get Tim to open up, about him possibly being the serial murderer that she once killed in a hit-and-run accident a 79 year old woman.
<br /><br />Tim who is said to have a genius IQ doesn't seem to pick up on Gina's attempt to trap him even when he later sees her at a bowling alley with her fellow cops spending a night out.
Playing some weird cat and mouse game with her Tim at one point get's Gina, at knife point, to admit that she's wired.
But Gina tells him that she was forced to do it by the police to get a break and an early release from prison.
Besides Tim's instability and criminal actions we find out that Gina isn't all there as well.
She seems to be suffering from her being rejected by her father who left her, with a drunk and abusing mother, as a young girl that's effecting her work as an undercover policewoman.
<br /><br />There's also the fact that Gina's lover policeman Will McCaid (Jeff Fahey), who's estranged from his wife and two kids, who's also on the serial murder case is too overprotective of her.
That causes Gina to almost blow her cover and that has her later being taken off her assignment.
<br /><br />Put back on undercover duty by her boss Capt.
Cheney (Dan Conway), over the objections of Officer McCaid, after another young boy, 12 year-old Davy Marish,was found murdered Gina finally get's herself together and gets Tim to admit that he's the person who's responsible for the string of murders in the area.
Gina does it by having a hidden tape recorder that she replaced the one that she gave to him to show how honest she is, hidden on her.
<br /><br />The movie \""In the Company of Darkness\"" wasn't really that exceptional but the acting by Helen Hunt Jeff Fahey and especially Steven Webber was.
It was these high caliber performances that lifted the film well above the average made for TV movie were used to seeing."""
5623_10	Farrah Fawcett gives the best performance by an actress on film in this gritty real life attempted rape thriller where she turns the tables & gives James Russo a taste of his own medicine.
A must see for any movie fan.
5446_9	"National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters, lots of laughs, and some great music from Chuck Berry.
When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion.
One by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a horny fat guy, the high school beauty, the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool.
This film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so I wouldn't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens.
If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or killer special effects you might not love Class Reunion.
If you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun (and who doesn't) then this movie should be on your movies to see list.

8450_7	"Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006.
But the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home.
<br /><br />FIRST MATCH- RIC FLAIR VS.
EDGE W/ LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener, these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match.
Flair wins by DQ after Edge slams him with his MITB briefcase.
3/10 SECOND MATCH- TRISH STRATUS VS.
MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these Divas faced off in the ring together.
Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks & nails her own Chick Kick for the win to retain her title.
3/10 THIRD MATCH- TRIPLE H VS.
BIG SHOW Seriously good this match was, really.
The whole match HHH focuses on Big Show's injured arm but Big Show still fights back.
Later HHH is able to topple down Big Show & nails a Pedigree for the win.
5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W/ MAMA VS.
VISCERA {This was a bonus match} Not that bad, it was alright.
After Viscera was down, behind the referee, Benjamin's mama got a purse {Which had bricks in it} & slammed Viscera on the head with it three times.
Viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by Benjamin for the win against the big man.
4/10<br /><br />FIFTH MATCH- JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS.
GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow & sloppy.
Both men didn't really put a very good effort.
Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win.
2/10<br /><br />SIXTH MATCH- TORRIE Wilson VS.
VICTORIA VS.
ASHLEY VS.
MARIA VS.
CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST EVER WOMEN'S GAUNTLET MATCH It was pretty entertaining to me.
Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice last to win the first ever Women's Gauntlet match.
5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA VS.
CHRIS MASTERS VS.
CARLITO VS.
SHAWN MICHAELS VS.
KANE VS.
KURT ANGLE W/ DAIVARI IN AN ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool Elimination chamber match.
But nothing will top last year's Elimination Chamber which was the best.
The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito.
Carlito turns his back on Masters & gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him.
Seconds later Cena gets a roll-up on Carlito for the three count to win the Elimination Chamber & retain his WWE Title.
But his night was not over yet.
7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out & congratulates Cena for his victory.
Vince McMahon states that his night is not over yet, & says that Edge cashes in his Money In The Bank opportunity to challenge Cena for the title.
Edge comes out with Lita, gives the briefcase to Vince & heads off in the ring as Cena has one more match to go here tonight.<br /><br />EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS.
EDGE W/ LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena who is busted open during the Chamber match} gets pounded straight away by Edge, Edge then nails a Spear on Cena, goes for the cover & to his shock Cena breaks out.
Edge nails another Spear & covers for the shocking three count as he has beat Cena & has won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career.
1/10 So last year's New Years Revolution was better than this year's, but it was still alright.
The EC match was also good & the shocking of Edge cashing in his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the PPV show.
<br /><br />Overall: I'll give it 7/10 & a C"
10813_10	"I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I am now reading.
I'll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in, but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece.
It's pretty much a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time, old trends exaggerated for humor.
We see modern black movies do the same thing, but with the new trends (stereotypes), \ho's\"" and the \""hood\"" and such.
I think if you look back in eighty years, you would find today's movies will look just as racist.
What viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and the pint-sized Sammy Davis Jr., who out taps his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult.
Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it.
Why not enjoy it for what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?"""
7822_8	"It's sad to view this film now that we know how the ANC got shafted by international capitalism.
Biko died for nothing much.
Woods achieved little.
Yes, outright apartheid was abolished, but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent.
As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine, in the talks between the black and white leaderships \the deKlerk government had a twofold strategy.
First drawing on the ascendant Washington Consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy, it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as \""technical\"" or \""adminsitrative\"".
Then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the ANC.
\"" The statistical results are horrifying, with not much change accomplished, and AIDS flourishing.
Viewing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic.
The ANC has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem."""
778_10	"I'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details, but this movie just hit me deep.
I don't think I'll ever forget it.
One scene especially (I think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one I am speaking) is imprinted on my brain.
<br /><br />I also watched the similar movie Lilja 4-ever (as referred to by a previous commentator).
It was also very moving, but not quite as straight to the point and brutal.
If you are sensitive at all, either will bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) may stay with you forever.
<br /><br />This is very depressing subject matter, but I think, no, I HOPE that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it.
<br /><br />More people need to see this film!!!!!!"
12041_9	"This is a plain old spooky ghost story.
I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept spellbound until the ending! No blood or gore- just good old fashioned suspense.
It starts out right from the beginning, and builds and builds.
The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares.
<br /><br />Well directed and well acted.
It is also a \period piece\""- set in the 1920s- which added to the atmosphere.
<br /><br />I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon.
The movie follows the book rather closely.
<br /><br />It's a shame it's not readily available on DVD.
My copy is VHS.
This along with \""Haunted\"" are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I've ever scene.
Which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes \""in your face\"" gore any day!"""
3114_9	"Im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you.
This movie is awesome.
From beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills.
The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it.
Damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role.
He is this role.
A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne.
This is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way.
Some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating.
The ending is left open for sequels and I sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad.
Excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.<br /><br />P.S.
The shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but I still think we could do without it.
The good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action."
7028_9	"Saw this as previous viewer by accident, I have watched it twice now.
I thoroughly enjoyed it, no silly thought provoking messages just plain good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and a just a feel good film Highly recommended to those of us that just like to enjoy films and not dissect them Great Fun for all the family here.
I didn't realise Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sultry.
The songs like One Boy and One last Kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your feet to Jason Alexander is the complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman ans is very good.
Tyne Daley still sticks in my mind from Cagney and Lacey and her voice and accent still had that remembrance in it.
Overall I just loved it and will be looking to purchase it if it is available"
7465_10	"Warning: Does contain spoilers.<br /><br />Open Your Eyes<br /><br />If you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it.
You have to see this film.
I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film.
That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.
<br /><br />If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.
<br /><br />I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well.
His name was Mr.
Krisak.
To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on.
If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it.
Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time.
This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds.
<br /><br />I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix.
Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr.
Krisak.
But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him.
But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable.
<br /><br />He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real.
Show me how you can tell that you are real.
This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine.
Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real.
After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.
<br /><br />\What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?\""<br /><br />What if you were someone else's dream? What a messed up question that is.
This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers.
How possible could it seem back then? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.
<br /><br />Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas.
But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to.
In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.
<br /><br />Open your Eyes.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines.
He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them.
<br /><br />Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz.
David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship.
This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life.
And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth.
<br /><br />Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee.
Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends.
This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film.
Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again.
And that is \"" the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter.
\"" He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.
<br /><br />At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress.
This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another.
And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia.
To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David.
David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another.
There is no hanky panky.
The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials.
<br /><br />That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception.
We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze.
There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life.
This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.
<br /><br />Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret.
Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze.
Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters.
And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through.
I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand.
To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film.
All of the ersatz so called \""Best Pictures of the year\"" have been good but nothing spectacular.
They lack substance.
A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven.
Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it.
I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it.
<br /><br />This is what film making is supposed to be like.
This is what a film is supposed to do to you.
It is supposed to make you feel something.
Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces.
This one isn't.<br /><br />10 out of 10 The best film of the year.
I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor.
Cameron Crowe should there as well.
None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame.
This is one film that should not be missed.
<br /><br />And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr.
Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question.
Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement? This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers.
And I'm sure that is just fine with him.<br /><br />Open Your Eyes"""
5131_10	"Jammin' the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short from 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam.
Marie Bryant sings \The Sunny Side of the Street\"" at one point for the film's highlight then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most entertaining \""jam session\"" to its exciting end.
The director Gojn Mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the '40s.
According to some notes I read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time.
What a shame.
Still, this most unusual film of the time is available on YouTube so if you love jazz, I suggest you seek it out there."""

I was very pleased with it and truly couldn't' ask for more.
I actually own the film because I didn't return it to someone...
Which I should do, but I really want to keep it due to how much I enjoyed it.
Also, the fact I don't own too many foreign films and this is a first.
Now, I personally love Finnish stuff so, that definitely added to how much I enjoyed it.
But overall, its worth watching.
However, if you're not into the whole trying to understand Finnish or read Subtitles bit, then this film is not for you.

Love or loath him, sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go 'Hey! This guy is a GREAT actor!' He did in the leather pants of Jim in The Doors and he's done it again in the leather underpants of John.

4564_10	"If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone, disabled or not, to persevere despite the odds and make it (even when \make it\"" as an expression, proper, can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth), MY LEFT FOOT is it.
It's a hard film to watch at times: seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction, and at a dinner table when the woman who's reached out to him, made him able to communicate effectively, now has announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) she is about to marry another man -- is tough.
Very, very tough.
More so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how: via screams, shrieks, and profanities aimed at hurting himself.
However, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account, but that of a man overcoming his severe disability, becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world.
Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker did so as well for her supporting role as Brown's solid mother."""
11904_10	"I gave it a 10, since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to.
The reason I'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on Castle's work.<br /><br />I've seen \Homicidal\"" and \""The Tingler\"" (the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white) a few times and \""The House On Haunted Hill\"" many times.
<br /><br />Even I am not old enough to have seen them when Castle was up to his showman tricks, thus I can appreciate them for their own merit.
And while most pass him off as second-rate, schlocky, hammy, etc., I believe they do him a disservice.
<br /><br />The end sequence of \""Homicidal\"" is GENUINELY shocking and works today - and the premise of \""The Tingler\"" while silly, was highly original.<br /><br />But \""The House On Haunted Hill\"" was a TRIUMPH.
Having used that Frank Lloyd Wright house as its exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid cast, plus a good score and production values - when I first saw it at a packed late-night showing in the late Sixties, it produced an audience reaction I'd not seen before and have not seen since.<br /><br />It was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you've not seen the film, stop reading NOW) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall.
<br /><br />With NO telegraphing of what is coming, the camera slowly pulls back, forcing the AUDIENCE to switch their gaze to...
I'm saying no more (my \""spoiler\"" declaration above only covers THIS movie).
<br /><br />The point is, I believe this ploy was DELIBERATE - not accidental - and when it happened, the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMED (including most of the men!) It took the audience about TEN MINUTES to calm down.
<br /><br />Now THAT is superior film-making.
A flamboyant showman he might have been, but \""House\"" and the other two films I've mentioned were GOOD MOVIES.
Castle may not have been a Hitchcock, but he was no Ed Wood, either.
<br /><br />It's easy to concentrate on someone's quirks and forget to examine their TALENT.
So I hope this documentary acknowledged that.
I look forward to seeing it."""

9181_10	"I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries.
I had read and watched many classics before, and I believed that most classics were boring, over-worded, and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best.
This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress, and she gives a wonderful portrayal of Jane Eyre.
Her accent is delightful and her quiet, yet firm nature matches the young governess' character exactly.
Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester.
His passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.
I couldn't sleep at all the night after I had watched this miniseries.
The plot is both haunting and inspiring.
The characters are masterfully performed, and the story is incredible.
This is the best version of Jane Eyre to ever appear on film.

First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing! Such a pretty little girl.
Her acting was superb as well.
True to life and very human.
Though I don't like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was only a fake prop.
Either way, she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving.
I found myself immersed in the story and her character.<br /><br />It's quite interesting how I came to discover this movie actually.
I was walking in blockbuster and I just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as I was walking by.
Luckily I glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in! I thought to myself, 'Awe, look at her!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as \A Little Gem.

After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew that I would end up regretting not renting this film, so I went back to the spot in which I originally found it and snapped it up.<br /><br />It had been on my dresser for a week, since school started for me this week and I really hadn't any time to watch it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity.
I popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography, delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end.
I was so captivated and must say, some parts nearly moved me to tears.<br /><br />I would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta.
He was remarkable.
Also the actor who played Carol's father, who's name is unfortunately not listed on the site.
His voice was just so loving and gentle that I could really sense his love for Carol.
Even though his appearance is not prominent, I really felt his character's presence.<br /><br />This is truly a wonderful movie.
If you are a person who is moved by light, but emotional films, then this is definitely one for you."""
11548_10	"Based on Neil Simons play of the same The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix Unger(Jack Lemmon)and Oscar Madison(Walter Matthau)who end up sharing Oscars massive bachelor pad after Felix tries to kill himself.
<br /><br />He had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram.
She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened.
Felix turns up at Oscar's during his weekly poker game with their friends Vinnie(John Fielder)Murray the policeman(Herbert Edelman)Roy(David Sheiner)and Speed(Larry Haines).
After some side splitting hysterics it's agreed Felix will stay with Oscar.
<br /><br />The rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters.
As well as looking at if Oscar can stand Felix's truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if Felix can stand Oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything.
Really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys,highs,lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship.
With great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British Pigeon sisters who Oscar invites over for a double date.
<br /><br />This one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are fantastic with a great chemistry.
Also made into a successful and equally funny TV series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix."
11094_9	"This slick and gritty film consistently delivers.
It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking \but I loved GET SHORTY\"" you need to be punched in the face).
In my opinion, no one captures the \""feel\"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP.
The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights.
Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie.
For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up.
My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.
I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."""
6435_7	"I think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don't understand how to watch a movie and/or have little sense of elegance.
First, to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together.
Modern sensibilities demand great drama.
No, I don't mean great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic.
This is a subtle movie.
Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity).
Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie.
It is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness, politics, human weakness, venality...you name it.
The world it's set in would be alien and not understood today...a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it NOW and LOUDLY, even if you only think you have it.
<br /><br />Many people today don't understand that Victorian society wasn't really Victorian as people understand that term today.
<br /><br />This movie helps set the record straight."

Posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler.
This is a good, light movie for Saturday night before you go out.
The soundtrack rocks, the outfits are out of this world, the script is funny and the actors do a great job.
The redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche.
I believe Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broke.

6473_8	"This is a very engrossing BBC-TV mini-series which is loosely based upon a mysterious disappearance of a young mother, but the series is really more of a study of the assorted characters in the story, which lasts for five hours.
It is thus very much an ensemble piece, where the wide variety of brilliant British actors and actresses can show off their talents.
The actual characters portrayed are really 'the kind of people one does not normally meet', people so boring and nondescript that it is difficult to admire them.
For instance, the lead character is a young husband (the one whose wife disappears) who has no job and no apparent interest in finding any.
He lives off handouts from his parents-in-law.
He was once in the Army but does not appear to have the slightest flicker of any ambition or any interests in life apart from doting on his small family.
He is played by David Oyelowo, who is brilliant at the part, coming across as a totally sympathetic person, although his only activities for five hours are loving and grieving, which he does superbly, so that one wants to comfort him, as he is so obviously a nice guy.
The standout performance of the whole series is unquestionably Penelope Wilton, who acts circles round everyone else in the story.
She is simply incredible.
She portrays a very unsympathetic woman, indeed the only character in the story who is all too familiar to everyone, namely an irrational, hysterical, self-centred, dense, querulous, blindly loving and blindly hating, elderly idiot-woman.
Alas, alas, we know them too well.
Wilton is one of Britain's finest actresses (see my review of her in 'Half Broken Things').
She takes a character who could have been two-dimensional and makes her four-dimensional.
She is wonderfully supported by old pro Patrick Malahide, who plays her exasperated husband, and the pair of them set a high standard indeed for all the younger players.
Janet McTeer, a spectacular actress when younger, has become a much less sympathetic type of person now that she is older, has coarsened in some way, and puts one off, but she redeems herself in the latter stages of the story by showing how brilliant an actress she can be when she has a chance by pulling off one of the most convincing and original drunk scenes I have ever seen on film.
The big surprise is the enigmatic character Sarah, played with great depth and originality by actress Sarah Smart.
She takes a character who could have been insufferably tedious and by sheer acting magic turns her into a deeply mysterious and intriguing person, about whom we wonder tirelessly for the entire five hours.
She is so good at it that we end up wondering about Sarah Smart, frankly.
I guess that's what happens when you really do your job properly, that people wonder where the character ends and the actress begins, if she knows herself, that is, and many do not.
She has some deeply unnerving tricks with her eyes, which wobble and let us know she is unhinged, but we are not sure how or why, though we eventually learn that she had an extremely violent and traumatic childhood.
Her mastery of ambiguous facial expressions is extraordinary.
Rory Kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much, but who turns out to have hidden depths.
(I suppose most people have hidden depths, but do we want to plumb them, that is the question.) His mum is played very well indeed by Margot Leicester.
A superb performance is given by Lucinda Dryzek, who plays a snotty, revolting teenage girl of the sort we all dread to meet, but who at crucial moments collapses in helpless tears and turns out to be pathetic, with all her arrogance just a pose.
Three other children are also very good, Lucinda's friend, and her younger half-brother and half-sister.
The younger siblings may be very dim indeed as characters in the story (they seem unable to say anything particularly articulate, being hopeless witnesses to the disappearance), with little to recommend them but their sweet natures, but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by Lee Massey as the boy and Tyler Anthony as the girl.
Harriet Walter has a small role, but we do not get to see much of her, which is a shame, as she is such a fine actress that she was wasted here.
One could go on, but one must draw a line somewhere.
The series manages to be strangely fascinating because of the depth of portrayal of all these essentially uninteresting people caught up in a web of intense anxiety and suspense."
11546_9	"First ever viewing: July 21, 2008<br /><br />Very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film.

5594_10	"Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler)<br /><br />The world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown.
This was to be the start of a legendary career.
This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.
<br /><br />It is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances.
She retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her.
The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love.
Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty.
With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support.
It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded.
'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time...
Some thought it to be scandalous.<br /><br />She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce.
The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness.
She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air.
Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake.
And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film.
Her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous.
But the audiences couldn't stay away.
As with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.
<br /><br />Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes.
After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other.
Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism.
However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments.
Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.
<br /><br />It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part.
Many might have presumed it was career suicide.
Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM.
There are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards.
It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's.
Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination.
But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.
<br /><br />The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable.
However, the consequences of that meeting are not.
The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.
<br /><br />I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD.
It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr.
But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time.
'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.<br /><br />www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews!!!"
10118_7	"I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fu**ed my head.
Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing.
The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well.
I haven't seen the UK or Japan version, but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored.
If you haven't seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria.
The I-ON DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes, but at the showdown I felt that something was missing, about one or two very short scenes.
<br /><br />All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I like Miike for!!"
2742_9	"Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE.
They really play well together (try them on separate nights).
It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well.
These two truly enhance each other.
Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well.
Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote.
I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD.
It makes for a powerful experience!"
2363_7	"This adaptation of M.R.
James's short story 'A View From A Hill' was first shown on British television in 2005, on the little watched digital channel BBC 4.
I saw that it was being repeated again on BBC 4, and decided to give it a go, remembering the BBC's successful 1970's adaptations of other M.R.
James stories including 'Whistle And I'll Come To You My Lad' and 'The Signalman'.
Though not in the same class as these masterpieces, 'A View From A Hill' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama.
<br /><br />A historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts.
Whilst out in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years.
But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill? And what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation? Whilst not scary in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation.
As it is, it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome.
<br /><br />I give it 7 out of 10."
9702_10	"the town of Royston Vasey is a weird, but wonderful place.
The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well.
Most people will know others with a touch of some characters, but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as Tubbs and Edward, the stranger-hating owners of the local shop, or the pen-obsessed Pauline who treats \dole scum\"" with much contempt.
That was only a few of the strange inhabitants.
The TV works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special.
There are references to many horror films, such as the wicker man.
A more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the league of gentlemens apocalypse, of which I will not say much but highly recommend.
All in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters.
I would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it!"""
876_7	"A super, unusual film from Audiard, Read My Lips is a pulpy, lonely- hearts thriller.
It's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of Vincent Cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from Emanuelle Devos.
Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard pops up for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.
<br /><br />This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness.
Yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in Cassel's ex-con Paul.
Each exploits the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement.
Devos/Audiard manage Carla's deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.
<br /><br />In this film (2001) Audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension, action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - A Prophet - of nine years later.

I have to say I was favorable impressed.
If anything the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, who have had success through the years.
As a Brit I was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on.
One question springs to mind - Was the screenplay written using the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (weird I know, a Brit who understands baseball) I have to say that it added to the enjoyment."

Season #9 should be a thrill in itself.
I wish that Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season, as I love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill.
The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season.

But the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke, at best.
It is funny.
(At least the synchronized German version is).
The action is good, too, with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher.
But the focus is squarely on the humour.
Not intelligent satire, not quite slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of funny jokes.
<br /><br />However, this film is the opposite of political correctness.
Legal drug abuse is featured prominently, without criticism, and even displaying it as cool.
That's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me, and renders it unsuitable for kids, in my opinion.
<br /><br />All in all, for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect.

He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson.
They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife.
Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who's in love with Mitch.
Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including \""Imitation of Life,\"" \""All that Heaven Allows,\"" \""Magnificent Obsession,\"" and many others.
<br /><br />Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.
There's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase.
We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch.
Mitch wants nothing to do with her.
He's so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation.
I doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.
<br /><br />Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up Kyle's messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety.
Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.<br /><br />In Sirk's hands, \""Written on the Wind\"" is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting.

I had no particular expectations of this film, though I am a big John Cusack fan, so I just let the movie wash over me.
And as a result I was quite entertained.
The political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the US military-business complex.

The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another.

6637_8	"Story says that on that on December 28, 1895, a small group of thirty-three people was gathered at Paris's Salon Indien Du Grand Café to witness the Cinématographe, a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named August and Louis Lumière.
The small audience reunited that day (some by invitation, most due to curiosity) didn't really know what to expect from the show, and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen, most thought that the Cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slide-show projections.
Until the photograph started to move.
What those thirty-three people experienced in awe that cold day of December was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day.
<br /><br />Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day, \La Sortie Des Usines Lumière\"" (literally \""Exiting the Lumière Factory\"") was the very first to be screened.
The film shows the many workers of the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory, leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work.
While a very basic \""actuality film\"" (movie depicting a real event), the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise, as their concept of moving pictures was limited to Edison's \""Peep Show\"" machines (the Kinetoscope), the brothers' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe, as the people and the horses moved across the screen.
The idea wasn't entirely new (Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888), but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary.
<br /><br />\""La Sortie Des Usines Lumière\"" would become the first in the long series of \""actuality films\"" that the Lumière would produce over the years.
This primitive form of documentary was the brothers' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the Cinématographe could have.
Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm, after the first showing the Cinématographe became a great success and \""La Sortie Des Usines Lumière\"" quickly became an iconic image of that first screening.
It definitely wasn't the first movie the brothers shot that year, and it probably wasn't the best of the 10 movies shown that day (personally I think that \""L' Arroseur Arrosé\"" was the best of the 10); however, it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates, as literally, this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it.

8060_9	"****SPOILERS**** Powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it.
Until like in the case of bull-like Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen, it's too much too late.<br /><br />It's 1922 and the hight of the Black & Tan Irish revolt against the mighty British Empire with the Tans, British occupying troops, on the lookout for wanted Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, wanted for the killing of a Briish soldier.
Gypo a good, really the best, friend of the fugitive McPhillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, forced to turn tricks in the Dublin red-light district in order to pay her rent.
<br /><br />After an outraged Gypo worked over a potential John who want's to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, an angry Katie tells the not so bright Gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has , her body.
Katie also tells Gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in.
Telling the mind-numbed Gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to America, and get out of the poverty of Ireland, Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip that he just saw announcing a reward of 20 pound sterling.
Thats enough money for both him and Kaite to travel to America.<br /><br />Gypo going to a local Dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend Frankie McPhillip.
Frankie tells him that he snuck into Dublin to see both his mother Mrs.
McPhillip and sister Mary, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his Irish Republican unit outside the city.
<br /><br />All Gypo can see in Frankie's face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police! Without as much of a second thought, after he assured Frankie that everything is all right, Gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and Tan shootout in his moms house.
<br /><br />With the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling, much like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him.
You can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip.
Even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the British Empire.
That's how low traitors or informers are held even by those whom they secretly work for.<br /><br />Gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of Frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind.
Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, pointing a finger and implicating him in Frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the British authorities.
Gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk, on the reward money, that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his Irish Republican Army colleagues, who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering Gypo on trial, the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring.
<br /><br />Whatever good feelings, if that's possible, that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered Gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation, in order to keep from getting shot, he falsely implicate an innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime of informing on his friend Frankie McPhillip.
Which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt-ridden Gypo himself.
The dye is then cast as straws are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in Gypo's head for the final gut spilling chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable Crime & Punishment classic."
12204_8	"One can only imagine the film Mr.
Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio! This film is a flawed Welles, but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America's best motion picture director of all times!<br /><br />We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie.
The story has a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director.
<br /><br />It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself.
No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr.
Welles.
Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended, or his films either on tape or DVD form.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here.
If she was a beauty with her red hair, as a blonde, she is just too stunning for words.
Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie.<br /><br />The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work, was his own appearance in it.
Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara, a different film might have been achieved altogether.
Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street.
The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work, the vision and the talent he gave us."
8928_10	"Films such as Chocolat, Beau Travail, and others have propelled French director Claire Denis into the top echelon of the world's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film The Intruder (L'Intrus) adds to the depth of her portfolio.
A cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss, the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by.
Loosely based on Jean-Luc Nancy's memoir of a heart transplant, The Intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective, impressionistic terms.
<br /><br />Louis Trebor (Michael Subor) is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who, like the professor in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time.
It is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation.
Though we see only one episode of violence, where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder, there is a sinister sense about him.
He might be an intelligence officer, a foreign agent, or a hit man.<br /><br />Whatever the case, he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences.
Facial close-ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation.
He lives with his dogs in a cabin in the Jura Mountains near the French-Swiss border and has an estranged son Sidney (Gregoire Collin) whom he has long neglected.
Sidney lives nearby with his wife Antoinette (Florence Loiret-Caille) and their two children.
In one telling scene, he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic, but that does not prevent him from taking his money.<br /><br />When the film opens, we meet Antoinette, a Swiss border guard, who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband.
When she comes home, she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongue-in-cheek if she has \anything to declare?\"" Other than these three individuals, the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in Louis' imagination.
Louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film's first half hour: a pharmacist (Bambou) who prepares his medication, a neighbor (Béatrice Dalle) who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is, and a young Russian organ dealer (Katia Golubeva) who he tells he wants a \""young man's heart\"".
<br /><br />Relentlessly, she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind.
In the last section of the film, Louis travels to South Korea in search of a heart transplant and to Tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son, one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen.
His heart transplant, however, appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart, a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless, intruding into other people's lives with little real empathy.
The Intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by Stuart Staples of the band Tindersticks, reminiscent of the guitar riff in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, and gorgeous cinematography by Denis regular Agnes Godard.
<br /><br />Godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret: a heart beating alone in the snow, an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes, the baby's expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile, colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship, a massage in a dark room by a mysterious Korean masseuse, and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck.
While The Intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature, Denis forces us to respond out of our own experience, to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level.
If there is any theme, a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film - \""your worst enemies are hiding, in the shadow, in your heart.\"""""
8872_8	"This is the first movie i've seen of John Singleton and he is a pretty good director.
The movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them.
Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work.
He is friends with Ice Cube and beings dating Tyra Banks.
Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and isn't sure about which way to go.
Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who falls in with a group of Neo-Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser.
Those are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them.
It's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie."
6964_7	"On paper this looked like a great concept: Average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator, who is really a hot Superhero who saves the world on a regular basis.
However, director Ivan Reitman and writer Don Payne (of the \Simpson's\"") almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero G-Girl (played by striking Uma Thurman) come off as a total nut job as both Superhero and secret identity persona Jenny Johnson.
The movie even cops to this in a conversation between Jenny and Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) following his rescue by G-Girl from the Statue of Liberty.
Jenny curiously asks Matt what was G-Girl like.
Matt replies, \""She's kind of nutty\"" I think the intent was to have Jenny (Thurman) be this lonely young woman, who has no one in her life, isolated by her great physical powers.
Thurman does the best she can, but her Jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of Prozac.
Luke Wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend.<br /><br />\""My Super Ex-Girlfriend\"" is also a victim of bad timing, coming on the tail end of \""Superman Returns\"" which plays Superhero straight up, so to speak.
With all its quirks and inconsistent writing I still thought \""My Super Ex-Girlfriend\"" was funny and enjoyed the movie.
Given that this is an Ivan Reitman movie, this could have been a lot better.
Reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it.
First off, we all love the hero.
Here neither Jenny nor G-Girl is really all that likable.
This is surprising for Uma Thurman, who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence.
In the beginning her Jenny/ G-Girl is just plain weird.
Shocking.
Because if there is a woman who can play a Superhero, she is Thurmanshe looks great.
Only toward the end does her Jenny become more sympathetic, instead of caricature.
Although \""My Super Ex\"" is not a straight Superhero story, rather a romantic comedy of sorts, it does not provide what every Superhero mythology requiresa great super villain.
Here we have Professor Bedlam aka Barry (Eddie Izzard) who really is evil lite.
He is no Lex Luthor.
No plans for Global domination.
Bedlam rather Barry does hold a grudge against G-Girl, and expectedly it has to do with their shared past.
What is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withBedlam or G-Girl? Luke Wilson's Matt is just \""some dude\"" who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero.
One of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation).
Wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense, and this dilutes his likable charm.
This does however work, in the comic sex scene with Jenny.
Matt while dating Jenny/ G-Girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker Hannah (perky Anna Faris).
So how does Matt break up with G-Girl? Well, it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious.<br /><br />Dramatic Superhero movies work.
Romantic comedies with chemistry work.
What may be inherently difficult are Superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies.
Everyone loves the hero.
However, hero nut job? Maybe not.
With all Uma Thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly.
And she does not get sufficient support from Reitman and Payne.
Thurman and Wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings.
\""My Super Ex-Girlfriend\"" is fun and funny.
Though given all involved, the movie could have been super."""
3392_7	"This was a very thought provoking film, especially for 1973.
At the time it was actually a huge box office success.
After the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely.It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time...no one had ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect'before 1985, and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up.
<br /><br />The sets and special effects might look a little outdated, but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period.
If you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense.
This is a message movie, not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions.<br /><br />This was also Hestons last good film, the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy.
After that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash.
THis might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made, and the ending might be creepy and depressing, but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this."
9722_7	"Simon Pegg plays the part of Sidney Young, a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous.
He is making a career out of lampooning celebrities, although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself.
The movie is based on the very bizarre career of Toby Young, who also ran a small magazine in Britain called the Modern Review, which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable, until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his co-editor, and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for Vanity Fair, which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie.
<br /><br />He is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication (called Sharp's Magazine in the movie), and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day.
He meets the chief editor, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges), who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof-off like Young to keep his job at the magazine.
He offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of Young, but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of Young's off-the-wall antics and inappropriate behavior.
<br /><br />Much of the comedy in the movie is derived from Young's misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous.
But Sidney's reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and, it would seem, he believes in that age-old saying  'If you can't beat 'em, join 'emand THEN beat 'em.\<br /><br />Complicating matters are two very different women.
There is a charming, regular girl at the magazine named Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) who at first is appalled by Sidney's obvious arrogance and womanizing ways, and a stunning model named Sophie (Megan Fox), who represents the celebrity culture.
Needless to say, Sidney's endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for Sophie, the one with the look of a star.
<br /><br />Sophie is stunningly beautiful, it's true, but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head.
Alison is a regular girl, not very interesting or attractive, but Dunst's performance makes her a real person.
A relationship with her would have all the reality of a Britney Spears marriage, and yet the movie retains some level of believability because, despite how obvious this is, we also feel Sidney's pain in not pursuing her (I felt it, anyway).
<br /><br />How To Lose Friends and Alienate People has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest, satisfactory performances, and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act, it has a variety of well-developed and interesting characters.
Danny Huston, for example, gives us a great performance as Alison's other love interest, who pays homage to The Big Lebowski (also starring Bridges) with his ever-present White Russian, one of my personal favorite drinks.
Buying Absolute and Kahlua here in China costs the equivalent of about $350, but my kitchen is never without them.
<br /><br />I am looking forward to the day when Simon Pegg will branch out a little bit, because I love his films but I am completely unsure about his range.
He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him, and ultimately went back to being himself again, which he has pretty much been in Shaun of the Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run, and now How To Lose Friends.
He's a rising star, it will be interesting to see what else he can do."""

2029_8	"As a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie.
There are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does.
I would love to know if Brian does his own riding in the film.
Would also like to know if he enjoys horses.
Brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden.
Where did he learn to ride? The only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt, like a horse can run forever at full steam.
The camera-work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse.
It would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders."
7584_7	"This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, \Enough already!\"" Of course, it isn't nearly as beautiful as Woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes.
Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future.
When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear her name.
Wilson gets to pull Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger.
Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me.
Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs.
I particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck.
My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Don's simulator.
It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995."""
4664_8	"\Hot Millions\"" is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the marvelous cast assembled for it.
The movie is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screen play and appears as the key figure of an enterprising embezzler.
The movie, directed by Eric Till, doesn't show signs of having dated as terribly, as some others from that period.<br /><br />At the center of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, fixes the income tax forms for the warden, who is amazed of the refund he is owed by the government.
Marcus, who is a genius at numbers, sees opportunities where others wouldn't.
He starts working for a firm that uses the latest computer for its accounting, but Pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different phony accounts in different parts of the continent.<br /><br />Marcus is assigned a secretary, who also happens to have a flat in his building.
The inept Patty is seen working as a bus fare taker who manages to make a mess of everything.
How she lands a job as a secretary is beyond comprehension, but things are never the same in the office when the creepy Willard Gnatpole decides to go after her, but have no fear, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is an accomplished pianist and she is a flutist and they make beautiful music together.<br /><br />The best thing in the film is Peter Ustinov.
He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and runs away with the film.
Mr.
Ustinov gives an assured account of the embezzler.
The excellent Maggie Smith is also at her best with her take on Patty, the kind woman who adores Marcus and who proves to be a genius herself when it comes to investing the money she finds in Marcus' pockets.<br /><br />Karl Malden is perfect as the American in charge of the corporation.
Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who desires Patty, but can't get her to reciprocate.
The marvelous Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity Marcus has assumed.
Cesar Romero appears also in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector.<br /><br />\""Hot Millions\"" will delight everyone looking for a fun time in the company of that unsavory, but charming character, Marcus Pendleton."""
3246_9	"I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing.
Everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting.
As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic.
It gets it's meaning across.
The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie.
Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are hilarious.
For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist.
However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose.
The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas.
All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie."
50_10	"My children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest.
I had to head out for bowling league so I had them record it for me on the dvr so I could watch the rest later.
Well I just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets.
It was an excellent movie even though I could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing.
And I never in a million years would have guessed the reason why Alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth.
This was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I've experienced that same pain that Alissia was feeling.
I too would not have sought out this movie, but I'm sure glad I saw it.
Very moving, very touching.
Great for those who love a good drama or tear-jerker."
2743_9	"In the year 2006, \In Cold Blood\""-a riveting thriller from 1967-has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have.
First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife.
Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, \""Capote\"" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote.
These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience.<br /><br />As a stand alone film from it's era, \""In Cold Blood\"" is top notch in every way.
Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later of \""American Beauty\"" and \""Road to Perdition\"" fame).
Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography.
Combined with the cracker-jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events).
It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen.<br /><br />The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo.
The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done.
Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last \""confession\"" so to speak.
It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography.
I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears.<br /><br />The only thing hampering \""In Cold Blood\"" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end.
The tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey."""

Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization.
But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave.
One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back...even if that means killing Tarzan.<br /><br />This is a rarity--a sequel that's better than the original.
\Tarzan, the Ape Man\"" of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged.
This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult.
There is tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares) but this was 1934.
There's also plenty of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints have Jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude! There's also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing and (it's implied) they sleep together and have sex--without being married.
This wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme.<br /><br />That aside, the movie is well-directed, very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement.
Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane's outfit is pretty revealing too.
I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan.
Everybody else is OK.<br /><br />This is easily the best Weismuller--O'Hara Tarzan out there.

12065_7	"\Insignificance\"" is a far from great film, from a stage play, directed by Nic Roeg.
In the scheme of Roeg's films, this is above the level of most of his post-\""Don't Look Now\"" work, which is characterised by judicious use of Theresa Russell as lead actress.
She's actually very good here, and far from the problem in other Roeg films like \""Bad Timing\"" and \""Cold Heaven\"".
As the \""Actress\"", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying her as a thoroughly depressive, but likeable siren.
She plays well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein, who is excellent to say the least.
He looks the part admirably, and while Theresa Russell doesn't look exactly like Monroe, she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true.
Other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell are.
A pretty workable, intelligent script is directed well by Roeg, but certainly not brilliantly, like \""Walkabout\"" or \""Performance\"".
As in other later Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague, insubstantial flashbacks, that add very little to the film.
In many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter (say, 60 minutes), more modest piece.
Still, a quite acceptable, passable film.
At times quite excellent, but somewhat lacking overall.

851_7	"Pierce Brosnan has sipped his last Martini and returns, in an outrageous self-parody, as the aging foul-mouthed boozy assassin Julian Noble, who has a particular fondness for teenage girls, bullfights and tacky clothes.
During a job in Mexico City he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a straight-faced Denver suburban business-man, who's in town to make his deal of-a-life-time, in a hotel bar.
Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's crude and insensible remarks, they become friends.
<br /><br />Largely carried by the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he didn't write the film with Pierce Brosnan in mind , but I can hardly imagine this without him.
He proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or cold-war spies.
The scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) really is a bravura piece of acting skills.
The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably carefully scripted, the two actors are largely improvising, but they succeed wonderfully! It almost feels like a new standard in screen acting.
Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichés and the actors' own typecasting (Brosnan's James Bond in particular), and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent Hollywood.
<br /><br />Sadly, the story wears thin after a while.
After an hour, the film just runs out of steam.
Nevertheless, and I can't put my finger on it exactly, I did enjoy this very much.
It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville.
The other characters aren't given much to do, but this film does offer something new, in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof.
Very amusing.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 7/10"

Now, this is nowhere near as good as South Park, but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire.

9383_8	"From the director of movies 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill me again', comes another movie in the noir style.
John Dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery, blackmailing in the early 90s.
Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction.
But nowadays Mr Dahl has resorted to directing television shows.Its a shame since the man had talent.<br /><br />***SPOILERS** This is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter Cage) that comes in to the town of Wyoming for a job.
However he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit-man from Texas by bar owner J.T Walsh.
He is given the task to kill his wife (Boyle).
But Cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it.
On the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road, who he then takes back to the local hospital.
At that point Cage coincidently meets Walsh again, who also appears to be the local sheriff.
After that Cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit-man that happens to be Dennis Hopper.<br /><br />John Dahl has co-written and directed this movie.
Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen.
The direction is of good standard, however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling.
There were too many close up frames.
However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience.
The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect.
Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght.<br /><br />Cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically, though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained.
His facial expressions were on the mark.
Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale.
Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees.
Hopper played his part well.
But I feel he was miscast for this role.
He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man.
The role was not written keeping his personality in mind.<br /><br />While viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like 'The Hot Spot' and 'A Perfect Murder'.
Due to the fact that some sub plots are similar.
Overall if you are a fan of noir movies, then this one is for you.
Worth recommending.

Although Sinatra was playing a not very endearing character,he was excellent in the role.
A lot of people seem to think that he did'nt really come into his own until his role in \From Here To Eternity\"" but in my opinion he was magnificent in Concho.
The other role that sticks in my mind is that of William Conrad.
I'd never see or heard of him before this film.
Conrad plays a terrific part in this film.I remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character.
Also I remember the music, that both introduces Conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears.
An excellent film and my only disappointment was that I never ever got the chance to see it again.
It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth.
I see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when I saw it was indeed in full color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt."""

7092_8	"There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys.
Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce.
It was entitled \Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts\"".
It ended with a simple message saying: \""please don't do any of the above in my movie\"".<br /><br />There is a fact about this movie (definitely true).
Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.<br /><br />I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.<br /><br />Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film.
It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness.
Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience.
Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate.
It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.<br /><br />I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular).
But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness.
He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular).
I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department.
Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.
<br /><br />Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one.
Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.<br /><br />It's been over a decade since this film was released.
When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged.
I had changed, of course.
And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes.
This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make.
A first rate film.

562_8	"This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between Jeff Webster(Jimmy Stewart) and Ronda Castle(Ruth Roman).
She takes an instant liking to Jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder.
They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction.
Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them.
Gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from Skagway to Dawson.
But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway.
She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff.
Meanwhile, Rene, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return.
Yet, she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson.
Along with Ronda, she nurses him back to health after Jeff is left for dead by Gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim.
Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff's long time sidekick.
He doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften Jeff's hard edges.
His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff.
<br /><br />John McIntire(as Sheriff Gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying.
Evidently, he sees something of himself in Jeff, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him.
He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.
<br /><br />Jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion Ben), who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job.
In this respect, he closely resemble's Burt Lancaster's character in \Vera Cruz\"", for example.
Thus, Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson, he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson.
Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive.
Then, Jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself.
He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon's gang from Dawson.
In this respect, he differs from Lancaster's character, who never reforms(But is Jeff truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)<br /><br />The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women.
Clearly, Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff.
Although she is clearly characterized as a \""bad\"" girl, Jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon.
Ironically, soon after Jeff changes from anti-hero to hero, Rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn Jeff of Gannon's impending ambush.
She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).<br /><br />It's clear that Corine Calvert, as Renee, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda, in Jeff's mind.
Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though Jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug.
Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in Rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later.
I'm also very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(He's not her father).<br /><br />Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon's gang.
If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk, before Jeff did the same to him.
And how did Jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims.
They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow.
And why weren't most of Ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?<br /><br />You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon's gang.
The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action.
All-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end.
No doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the US Skagway."""

The only other person she sees is the estate caretaker, a lascivious character played by Maxwell Reed, whose caught the wayward eye of the middle-aged aunt.
All of this, the aunt and the caretaker, the butterfly expert uncle who has a serious underside to him, and the susceptible niece in the middle, would have made for a darker and more sinister film.
As it is, a frame-up for a murder sends Trevor Howard (a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate cataloging butterflies) and Simmons across the countryside escaping police, catching headlines of \Police Net Closing In\"" over her front page photo, hopping on buses, and winding up in Liverpool, where they meet some wonderfully cast characters, and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle."""

\Nothing happened\"", as they say, but the duo do wake up in the same bed.
Suddenly Karen telephones.

Understandably, Paul hustles Becky out of the place, although her underpants are left behind.
But, there is even more fun ahead.
At a family dinner at Karen's parents' home, Paul runs smack into Becky again, learning that she is Karen's cousin.
Talk about some explaining to do! But, instead, Paul chooses to feign a stomach problem and hides out in the bathroom.
Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's place? And, what will be the consequences? I'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this.
They should definitely lighten up, for this film is fresh and fun.

This movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit Stallone putting in a good performance as well,an exciting plot,and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.
The movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.
The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special human,much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters.
They chose to humanise Stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style,weakens the excitement factor.
Also,the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.
The script should have been more realistic and less \talky\"".
Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.
The movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.
They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.
Instead,they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala \""A-Team\"" TV series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.
This movie had a lot of all time great potential.
Crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more Rambo/Rocky style emotion/determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.
I know this was not Stallone's fault.
I sense the movie's director wanted to tone down Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.
Sill a good movie though........"""
3116_10	"The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films.
It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme.
Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past.
Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.<br /><br />The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police.
The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off.
Or does it? The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things.
A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone.
They aren't his target.
From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs.
Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.<br /><br />The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything.
The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two.
And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney.
It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot.
All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever."
11840_10	"I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much, I've seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD.
Those who gave negative reviews would probably think that `Vanishing Point' was just another car chase movie and `Thelma & Louise' was just another chick flick.
Although the conclusions of those films are darker I feel the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you.
The other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.<br /><br />Another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else's home.
All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that.<br /><br />I thought the animation and the story were amazing, the animators really got the horses to look, act and move naturally.
Spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed (yes I'm aware they do humanize the horses a bit, but this is fiction).
In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire.
In other more quiet scenes (which are most of the time) you're allowed to savor the backgrounds.
One of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking, singing animals route.
Doing so would take away from the story's power.
Instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character, further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack.
Another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side (which really made this film watchable to me).
This isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy.<br /><br />Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but I think it's a bit more than a horse movie.
I don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today.
But if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty they'll likely love this movie.

Knowing how serious 9/11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9/11.

Britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it, but at warmth British films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor.<br /><br />This film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor, so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers.
It's a couple of decades later, Gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind.
He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses.
When students he's fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he's just all talk.<br /><br />This is a subversive film in that there's not the usual worldly character of any American movie that you expect to do whatever he does, but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles.
Maybe.
It's certainly no protest-by-numbers though, being too warm.
Where U.S.
film may seem realistic because they're urban and gritty, this and other British films of recent years - those that don't try to match America for visceral thrills - are real because British humour reveals truths."

If you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it."
6937_8	"This stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all.
James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout, only to lose it in a robbery.
The story details Stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film.
The rifle changes hands time after time, as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence.
The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry.
A great cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C.
Flippen.
Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure.
Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teen heartthrobs in later years, have brief but good roles."
11354_10	"CitizenX(1995) is the developing world's answer to Silence of the Lambs.
Where `Silence' terrorized our peace of mind, `Citizen' exhausts and saddens us instead.
This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well, thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals.<br /><br />CitizenX may also argue against(!) the death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey's The Life of David Gayle(2002).<br /><br />Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under which lie limbic brains (lizard-logic).
Why did two kids, who knew better, stone to death a toddler they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women yell `li-lilililililii' at acts of OBSCENE terrorism? -My own term for this is `limbic domination', the lizard-logic urge to dominate an `enemy'.
If you have the words `enemy'/`vengeance' in your vocabulary, you're easily capable of `limbic domination'.<br /><br />In WWII-devastated 1980s Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don river near the Black Sea), nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo's urge for `limbic domination' from overpowering his layers of civilization.
Chikatilo(Jeffrey DeMunn)'s easy victims were paupers, usually children, who rode the interurban train for fun, since they couldn't afford anything else.<br /><br />CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such `lambs'.
Rostov's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go.<br /><br />The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere.
Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world, in the west, vote-grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter-agency rivalries, stymieing a more coordinated response to crime.
In the Soviet Union of CitizenX, however, Viktor Burakov(Stephen Rea)'s Killer Department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy.<br /><br />Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority--to the point of complete obscurity.
In real life, too, Chikatilo had a lifetime's experience blending in and evading capture.<br /><br />His pursuer, on the other hand, sticks out as a strange bird, given to unheralded, naive outbursts.
Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief Burakov.
Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humourless and sullen, at odds with everyone.<br /><br />So it's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture.
Sutherland's Col.Fetisov, Burakov's boss, and at first his only supporter, is an overly restrained, patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations.
His reawakening as a logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film's cornerstone idealism.<br /><br />Joss Ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik, Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation.
Naturally, he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect, a Communist, in 1984, a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag, supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo.
<br /><br />Soon, he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov(John Wood), insisting that the investigation now focus on `known homosexuals'.
The funniest scene of this sad, sad film comes during Bondarchuk's & Gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: one stupid cop earnestly reports, `As I suspected, comrade, it's fornication.
I've made some drawings'--cue howling laughter.<br /><br />5yrs after the bodies began piling up, in 1987, the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles.
The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky(Max Von Sydow), who termed the UNSUB `CitizenX'.
He later also observed to Fetisov & Burakov that `...together you make a wonderful person'.
We concur.<br /><br />The drawn-out pace, spread over a decade, perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost--`openness'--that wasn't.
The contrast with Perestroika--`restructuring'--couldn't've been greater for the case.
Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations, police plans were about to bear fruit.<br /><br />In 1990, Col.Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General.
His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene, allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference.
Staff, communications, publicity--suddenly all were available.
In just one night of telephoning around, Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the FBI's Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico, where, Fetisov discovered, staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators.
<br /><br />Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief, now `Colonel' Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie's powerhouse watershed scene.
Fetisov's is the most tender apology I've ever seen on film: `Privately, I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife.
I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance', he almost whispers.<br /><br />A HBO production, CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber.
Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Randy Edelman's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality.
Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits.<br /><br />Chikatilo's actual murders are depicted as bleak, aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world.
This makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place--but of course they were.
As President Kennedy reminded us, `we all cherish the futures of our children'.<br /><br />CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply.
Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate.
So do some soldiers.
Such `limbic dominators' make poor humans.<br /><br />WARNING-SPOILER:----------------------------------------------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the world's most prolific known serial killer.
Convicted, he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet Union death sentences: one shot, in the back of the head.
Foolishly, such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death.<br /><br />Conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ The best outcome is always the prevention of killings, not their prosecution.
Executions merely guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW/WHY they died.
Nor do killers learn regret if they're dead.<br /><br />Vengeance doesn't unkill victims.
Baying for the killer's blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once it's too late.<br /><br />Vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn't justice for the deceased--it's appeasement of the living.(10/10)"
6025_9	"When this film was made, the hippie thing had gone mainstream.
The ideas of the counter culture was well established, that is why such a big film could be made.
Yet it has something to say, and it is said really beautifully.
Apart from those who're only waiting for the wanking material, this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes(which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film) by the most.
The soundtrack to this film, which actually became more popular than the film itself, is another plus.
Pink Floyd's \Careful with that axe Eugene\"" suits really well with the explosions, the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood.
But.
It seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most.
If you didn't understand it, which seems to be the case for the most, I'll give you some hints: The man(tough guy, what ever his name is-Mark?) is a part of a \""reality group\"".
He leaves this group saying something like \""I'm willing to die.
But not of boredom\"" He later go for a joyride with a stolen plane, probably to seek some action.
As he is in the air, Grateful Dead's Dark Star(from the Live/Dead album) is played(i think).
This song contains the phrase \""Shall we go you and I while we can\"", this is though not heard in the film.
(Perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential?) In the plane, he checks up a girl(Daria), who is driving in her car to a conference(about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super-relaxing place in the desert, where everything is so simple and nice.
For the whole family!), by diving down, almost hitting the car.
He lands the plane, and joins the girl on her way to Detroit.
They stop at Zabriskie point, where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature.
Later a family with a big car(of the type which you sleep in) and a speed boat is showed visiting Zabriskie Point, the father saying something like \""what a waste driving all the way up here\"", and the kid sitting inside the car, grinning.
I sensed a \""this wasn't much better than on the telly\""-attitude.
Daria takes Mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style, with the identity number changed to \""no war\"" on one side and \""no words\"" on the other.
\""Bucks Sucks\"" is also written on the plane.
Mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from, saying to Daria before he leaves \""I don't risk anything\"" or something, one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny.
(This because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds don't give him anything- \""I wonder what happens in the real world\"") On the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane.
Daria hears this on the radio, but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion.
Here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend.
She enjoys fresh water running down a rock, more than the swimming pool.
Inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti-materialism -She looks out through a glass wall, holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped.
The business men is seen arguing, the one side eager to make a big deal, the other afraid of losing money.
Daria leaves the house and looks back at it, visualizing it blowing up.
After the house, several other things blow up, for example a television.
She smiles, happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with Mark look upon as something negative.<br /><br />To summarize: Mark obviously experience the \""reality group\"" as not very useful as they just sit and talk, taking no action.
He clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are, and it seems like he feels that it's no use fighting against it.
He wants to leave.
He helps Daria, who is \""in mind but not in action\"" seeing his point of view.
Where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death, one can hope Daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive.
In the film you see how a town (LA) is being polluted by commercial (too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point), you see business men deciding what is the future, et cetera, and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world.
<br /><br />I have only seen the film once, so I have not caught all points, but I certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say, and I find it strange that this film can be called meaningless.
If you say the points are being too obvious, I can see why, this film probably intended to appeal to the post-hippie radicals \""digging\"" the thoughts of anti-establishment.
Even though, it has a lot to say, and its message is still needed today, things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties.
Zabriskie Point is a really great film, telling a story about quite normal young people (not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid, digging everything) seeking what they percept as real, dissatisfied with the conventional.
And it is done in a truly beautiful way."""
8280_8	"George and Kim are traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.
But what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey,where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit,half animal and half man Wendigo,haunts a small town...\Wendigo\"" by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.
The acting is great,the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.
The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined,or even if the story is taking place entirely in Miles' head.
Overall,\""Wendigo\"" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.
Give this film a chance,if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10."""

I think that Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today, but a movie like this isn't just worth her time.
She deserves better, and so does everyone else in this movie.
Talent is just wasted.
Sorry, but i don't feel like writing a review for this.<br /><br />I give it NO stars out of *****."

Very funny with plenty of action.
Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances.
I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career.
Donald Southerland plays a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt out hit man.

1677_9	"La Coda Dello Scorpione (a.k.a.
Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was director Sergio Martino's follow-up to the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh.
This is the quintessential giallo, featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love.
Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of Italian exploitation.<br /><br />A group of gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argento gialli around.
There's the aforementioned Martino adding his touches as director, giallo great Ernesto Gastaldi as the writer, Bruno Nicolai creating the music, and a host of giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli, and the fetching Anita Strindberg.<br /><br />With all this talent behind it, does Scorpione deliver? You bet.
The film works on many different levels.
It's a thrilling murder mystery, a tense and violent horror film, and a suspenseful thriller.
All in all one of the best gialli around.<br /><br />Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli.
At some points in the film, he almost seems to be channeling Argento in his approach.
For example, there is a direct rip-off of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage where the killer tries to break through the door, that actually outdoes Argento's flick.<br /><br />Are there any problems with the flick? Hmmm...
only minor ones.
First, any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore.
But just before you fall asleep, the killer will pop out of nowhere and you'll be right back in the swing of things.<br /><br />Also, towards the end, the twists get a little too bizarre.
I mean, what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve? If you don't play close attention to the dialogue, you could easily become lost with the twisting, weaving storyline.<br /><br />But these minor quibbles aside, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, suspenseful, classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans.
Seek it out!"
4465_7	"ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I wouldn't rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON.
This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together.
Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on leave in Hollywood who befriend a young boy (Dean Stockwell)who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) a struggling actress who is working as an extra at MGM.
Though both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually voices a preference to Joe but Clarence later hooks up with a waitress (Pamela Britton)who, he learns is from his hometown of Brooklyn.
The paper-thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including \We Hate to Leave\"", Joe and Clarence's lament to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship; Grayson's torrid rendition of \""Jalousie\""; Sinatra's dreamy rendition of \""I Fall in Love Too Easily\"" (a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film), and \""The Worry Song\"", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame.
Kelly also does a sort of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his Pirate's Ballet in the later THE PIRATE.
Kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy.
An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory."""
1899_7	"Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do.
According to his extremely rich father, Arthur has to marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson or he's cut off from the family money ($750 million dollars worth).
The problem is, Arthur doesn't love Susan (though I hear she makes some good chicken) and has just fallen head-over-heels for the waitress and part-time shop-lifter Linda Marolla.
Arthur is an interesting fellow.
He's really just a big kid, born into riches with at least one person looking after him every second of every day.
Working just rubs Arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun, womanize, and of course, drink.
Drinking gives Arthur a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble, it's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen.
<br /><br />Dudley Moore is great here in this film as Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win for his performance.
Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film, turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold, but he is also great in bringing Arthur down to a relatable level and making the character likable.
Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, the spirited nobody who Arthur can't get enough of, and John Gielgud is terrific as Arthur's butler Hobson.
Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in this film, and there's no doubting why.
Hobson has a stone-solid dry wit and stuck up attitude, but he's always looking out for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role.
Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple, but delivers laughs a-plenty."
9093_10	"I am the parent of a special needs child and I enjoyed the the movie very much! It was loving, warm and fun.
I learned a long time ago to see the humor in things.
I especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died.
I attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited.
Everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions.
We talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them.
The screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years.
She based the character on a real person.
Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times.
I give the movie two thumbs up!!!"
11490_9	"i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film, this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go.
All the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate,after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don't watch the movie making- just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child?"

Some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there.
However,i enjoyed this movie.The locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good.
If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good."""
7941_8	"This little seen movie is a languid and laid-back giallo.
It veers away from some of the cliché's of the genre and adopts a looser approach.
It's about a woman searching for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason.
Her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals.
In true giallo style, murder is never far away.<br /><br />The cast is really rather good.
We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o' Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80's scream queen).
The lead actress is Rosemary Dexter, and while I am not familiar with her, she does a good job in leading the picture.<br /><br />One of the defining features of Eye in the Labyrinth is its music.
Atypically for a giallo it features a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack.
This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, is reminiscent of Miles Davis, especially his work on In A Silent Way.
It's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli.
The fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny, sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of.<br /><br />This is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces.
Well, this film falls a little short in this regard.
It's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between.
The opening dream-murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence.
But this really isn't a particularly violent film.
Still, I don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre.
The mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy Saro and THAT unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent?) and moments of the bizarre to satisfy; while the sleaze-factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout.<br /><br />Eye in the Labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an Agatha Christie mystery, as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa, all under suspicion of murder; we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the (highly unsympathetic) murder victim.
While this isn't a grade-A example of the genre, it's certainly an appealingly different one, as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub-genre.
For giallo enthusiasts I give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice DVD transfer.
It certainly deserves the treatment."
8728_7	"Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made.
\A Bug's Life\"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking \""Toy Story\"", which was the first ever feature-length CGI movie.
I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but I never actually saw it until November 2006.
I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time.
It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've ever seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation.<br /><br />Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants.
These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year.
One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions, even though he doesn't mean to.
One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season, but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds \""warrior bugs\"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back.
Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering.
The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors, but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, he learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs!<br /><br />The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters.
To me, none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland.
Fortunately, however, it's not like \""Shark Tale\"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character.
\""A Bug's Life\"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for.
The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on.
The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, isn't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female.
You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception.
With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment."""
1941_9	"i actually thought this is a comedy and sat watching it expecting to laugh my ass off.
pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy, or at least not a 'Jim Carrey type' one.
what kept we watching was the characters - the movie starts with some pretty grim, troubled people, gathered together to try and fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming.
we start to get bit by bit into their lives, witness their troubles, guess of their thoughts.<br /><br />actually i made it look much darker than it actually is, and besides the chain of events soon brings some light and hope to their lives.<br /><br />i probably wouldn't have watched the movie had i known its not a comedy but rather a drama, but i had good time, enjoyed the story and don't mind i spent about 90 minutes with it.

4591_9	"It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up.
He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts.
To be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown.
But with 'Rush Hour 3', where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker (of all people!), and then there's 'Kung Fu Panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue...
to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.<br /><br />It's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, Chris Tucker-free days.<br /><br />Enter 'Police Story'.
Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial.
He faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.<br /><br />But on the other hand, who cares? We don't watch Jackie Chan films for the story.
We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.<br /><br />And on that level, 'Police Story' doesn't disappoint at all.
There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant, high-voltage chandelier.
Seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.<br /><br />There is also comedy, much of which involves Kar-kui inadvertently upsetting May (Maggie Cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend.
The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />The acting isn't too subtle, either.
Indeed, I'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'Police Story' at all.
Director Jackie Chan (yeah, he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.<br /><br />So 'Police Story' is a blast.
As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition.
I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new \Wow!\"" factor is added to the action."""
4661_10	"I can only echo the praise of the other reviews here.
It's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality.
Naturally sweet - no added sugar.<br /><br />One small point: it seems to me that the mild objections raised about Ustinov's character Pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius/savant at this sort of thing.
Yes, the film was pretty computer illiterate, but it did show Pendelton 'studying computers' at his flat, and I believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject, practically overnight.<br /><br />There were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff.
I'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that Pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations, or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear.<br /><br />Certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts.
Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at, it's necessary to know quite what their concept was.
They knew there was something about 'procedures' which was important; they thought that the 'smart light' could actually control security, rather than just indicate its state; they thought that the (dumb) user terminal's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though apart from things like graphics feature I don't see it meself.
<br /><br />Mostly, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could, and they did that rather well.
Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I don't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note.<br /><br />CD"
9227_9	"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! <br /><br />This underrated gem of a film tells the story of Flavia, a Fifteenth Century girl of Noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of Medieval Christian society by viewing a fallen Islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure.
<br /><br />Unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene where the Bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and, through butting up against a whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her.
<br /><br />Billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth.
This is a film depiction the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal dominance, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit.<br /><br />I described it in the title of this piece as 'post-feminist' and in the end Flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men.
Even Flavia's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men (the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror.<br /><br />As to the much discussed violence: this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess.
To have shied away from the violence would have limited the film's impact, would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the Patriarchal discourse it is exposing.
In addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (notably by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years Flavia is a classic of European Cinema."
2736_9	"A unique film...one of the best of all time.
Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc.
-- just fantastic.
As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery.
I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film.
<br /><br />The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them.
Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing.
Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible.
Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded.
Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully.
Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period.
<br /><br />The cops are wonderful too.
Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well.
Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence.
They seem so real.
I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back.
Really one of a kind in this respect.
<br /><br />PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record).
<br /><br />Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano.
This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film.
Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them.
But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions.
This is some of the best acting you'll ever see.
Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating.
<br /><br />To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel.
It works.
These seem like decent, simple folk.
It makes the crime so palpable and sad.
<br /><br />I'll stop here.
It's not a feel-good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff."
2712_10	"Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid.
Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric (\Vixen,\"" \""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\"") Gavin gives a robust, winning performance as a brassy, resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy, hellish penitentiary.
The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing a slow, steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly).
Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta (\""The Arousers,\"" \""Unholy Rollers\"") Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about Pinnochio.
Lynda Gold (a.k.a.
Crystin Sinclaire of Tobe Hooper's \""Eaten Alive\"" and Curtis Harrington's \""Ruby\"") makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice.
And the ever-cuddly Cheryl \""Rainbeaux\"" Smith does a lovely, touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from \""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural.
\"" <br /><br />Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force.
Demme's zesty, confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior.
Furthermore, both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and John Cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% on the money excellent.
Patrick Wright (Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler \""Track of the Moonbeast\"") has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom.

10907_9	"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, \Hey this looks like fun,\"" - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it.
At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body.
He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause.
He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality...
I cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried some more.
Once Jonni Kennedy's \""time was up\"" he flew to heaven to be with the angels.

819_10	"Despite the feelings of most \Star Wars\"" fans, in my opinion \""Return Of The Jedi\"" is the greatest cinematic film ever created.
Ever since the first time I saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me.
The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years.
Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the \""Star Wars\"" saga in \""Jedi\"".<br /><br />Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)<br /><br />After \""The Empire Strikes Back\"" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in \""Return Of The Jedi\"".
Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction.
The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side.
Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt.
After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; Darth Vader is in fact his father.
The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet.
Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed.
While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor.
It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks.
During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side.
In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions.
As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life.

3440_8	"Love Rosario Dawson, think she's one of the finest actresses of the modern era.<br /><br />Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else.
It's the consistent undertone in everything in the film.
The dialog is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided.
The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.<br /><br />Pitching this as a rape classic isn't appropriate, and that's probably why so many people don't enjoy the film.
The standard 'rape' audience wouldn't particularly like this film, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it does confront it's target audience, whether they like it or not.
There's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesn't slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Descent is a good film which IMHO is severely under-rated."
5941_8	"This is a fan-made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs Batman and Superman! It's the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like ComicCon and was made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora.<br /><br />As far as this film goes, I could easily pick it apart.
Sure the CGI effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect.
BUT, this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible.
I was particularly impressed by the very buff Superman--he was no wimpy little guy! If only this were a preview for a real film--they'd have fans lined up from here to Omaha to see it.
Great job."
765_9	"I guess when \Beat Street\"" made a national appearance, \""Flashdance\"" came at the same time.
The problem with \""Flashdance\"" is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet.
That was one of the reasons why \""Beat Street\"" was better.
The only movie that could rival \""Beat Street\"" seems to be \""Footloose\"", because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings.<br /><br />The break-dance scenes in \""Beat Street\"" come just before the middle and at the end of the flick.
And I loved all of them.
Almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the head spins, the suicide sit, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward flip, the figure four---almost everything.<br /><br />Like \""The Warriors\"", \""Beat Street\"" does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world...but in a much less violent way than the former.
The only major fight scene in \""Beat Street\"" was when graffiti artist Ramon (which in the movie was abbreviated as \""Ramo\"") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail.
Well, although that chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot.<br /><br />Most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture, and rap music.
A lot of rap music appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life.
Even the theme song of the movie, which closed the curtain to the flick, was not just an homage to hip-hop culture--it also was an homage to the death of Ramon.<br /><br />By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E.

This who-dunnit has a flair of comedy to it -- the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally.
Some fun gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend.
There's a lot of fun stuff in here, so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on.

10179_9	"De Grot is a very good film.
The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen.
Some really top-class acting, not only by Van Huêt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did TV-work prior to his performance of Axel van de Graaf.
The film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood.
Then we start to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie.
In the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats.
Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie.
A must-see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (The Vanishing's original screen adaptation)."
8532_7	"Lupin sets off for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure.
His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him.
It's a nice different location for Lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.<br /><br />One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than Lupin.
On one hand their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace.
Plus, this way, Lupin can focus on the ladies...<br /><br />Fujiko rules in this.
Throughout the entire feature she is seducing Lupin, and us viewers.
Then there's Lara, the damsel of this particular tale, and she's quite likable.
This one has more nudity than any other Lupin anime, which is a fun distinction to have.<br /><br />There's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this, and naturally he has some great fighting with Goemon, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko.
Inspector Zenigata of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form.<br /><br />Pretty much, this is a smooth ride with Lupin.
The plot is average and there are some slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure.

7205_10	"Deathtrap is not a whodunit.
It's a who gonna do it to who first.
It's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so I won't mention anything more about the plot.
As far as acting goes it is Cris Reeves greatest role as Clifford, a young playwrite.
You really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from \exhaling cheeseburgers\"" to downright frightening.
Clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this I have never seen Clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum.
The actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac.
Reeves is the only person I have seen who has the character right all the way through.
As for Michael Caine he's.....well he's Michael Caine.

8705_8	"Despite the title, The Sword Bearer, and the DVD cover (action/herioc poses of The Sword Bearer) this is not a super hero film.<br /><br />(Minor Spoilers) It follows the tale of Sasha, The Sword Bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm.
Cool you say, but no, this is real life.
If you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, faced by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her.
And if you don't control it, how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.<br /><br />This essentially is where Sasha is when we meet him.
Wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like A Bout de Soufflé).
He then meet Katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing Sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways.
However, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers.<br /><br />That is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested.<br /><br />I really like this movie.
Unlike many Hollywood 'super hero' films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count The Sword Bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.<br /><br />Worth checking out if you can find it."
980_7	"The summary line above, spoken by James Cloud (Robert Preston) to his brother Tom (Robert Sterling) just about says it all.
Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been.
Not the sort of mentoring Tom envisions for younger brother Jeff, who likes what he sees in Jim, especially when defending their ranch against local Texas cattlemen.<br /><br />The opening credits state 'Introducing John Barrymore Jr.
as the Younger Brother', in this his very first screen appearance.
That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as Jeff almost immediately into the story.
Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to Sean Penn.
No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family, I was left wondering if his daughter Drew Barrymore might have ever seen this picture.
I'm inclined to think not.<br /><br />On the subject of resemblances, I was also struck by the thought that the young Robert Sterling looked a bit like Roy Rogers early in his career.
Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as George Kerby in the early 1950's TV series 'Topper', I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that might just be me.
His character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble, and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story.
Minor subplots abound, including the relationship rancher John Gall (John Litel) has with his son the Sheriff (who Kid Wichita kills), and the troubled marriage between Kathleen Boyce (Cathy Downs) and her husband Earl (who Kid Wichita kills).
Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of Tom Cloud's hired hands, and figures in the somewhat predictable finale.<br /><br />What's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there, and for that reason, this Western earns points for following a less traveled, hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother/bad brother Westerns do.
Combined with the eclectic casting of the principals, it's one I'd recommend, even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that I experienced with my copy."

801_8	"I suppose JEDI is now chronologically to be considered the very \last\"" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these.
I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character(and also Mark Hamill, as an actor).
After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't so bad.
I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter.
The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy.
I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity.

4820_7	"What more can be said? I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago.
And although both Blanchett and Blunt have played Queens now( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses), the roles are complete polar opposites.<br /><br />Simply put if you are looking for high passion, compelling drama, and Machiavellian intrigue, this is not the movie for you.
This isn't to say that the script or direction was bad, its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like Elizabeth I, Anne Boylen, Henry VIII, Henry V, Henry II and Elainor of Acquitane.
These are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of British ,and in most cases, world history.
Victoria, in contrast, ascended the throne without incident, she quasi-governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the Navy, her State had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians, and she married young had a harmonious family life.
The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of.<br /><br />The heart of the film, aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne, is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story.
Marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion, yet Victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a Patron Saint marital fidelity, happiness and ideal family life.
Thus, central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert.
I was very taken with Rupert Friend's characterization of Albert whom he portrayed as a kind, patient, somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man, looking to\ do good in the world and help\"".
In short, he is a good man with a good heart, not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around, but as that is not the point of the story, that does not matter.
The heart of the character shines through thanks to Friend's understated yet earnest performance.
<br /><br />As for the Queen, well..Emily Blunt is sublime.
Her beauty cannot be denied, but she is more than something pretty to look at; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness.
The slightest arch of the eyebrow, glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much.
Again, this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas, its not that kind of movie.
But what Ms.
Blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety.
<br /><br />For example, we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by Victoria's mother ( Miranda Richardson) and her scheming adviser/lover Conroy expressed in the simple things like Victoria trying to sketch her dog.
We see her delight and fascination upon first meeting Albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him.
We see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing Parliament upon her Ascension.
And my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous, happy, and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her, a proposition so ridiculous for those times( and some would say now) that Victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say \""marry me\"".
Again, this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions, but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much.<br /><br />So, overall, I judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such I give it a 7.
I felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development, namely Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, and the characters of Conroy and Lord Peal.
Again, the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters, but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment.
Also I would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between Victoria and Albert, but that may be just my greed for more scenes between Friend and Blunt.
<br /><br />In summary, don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is, a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures.
I give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances, brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent Victoria of Emily Blunt.
And anyone who has any shred of romance left in them, you will be touched by the end of this movie.
God save the Queen."""

During WWII British Peter Carter's (David Niven) plane is shot down in combat but he survives.
He meets and falls in love with lovely June (Kim Hunter).
But it seems a mistake was made in Heaven--he should have died! A French spirit comes to get him but he refuses.
He is soon to plead his case in front of a Heavenly Tribunal that he should be allowed to live.<br /><br />Sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film.
The script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight-faced and it's beautifully directed--the scenes on Earth are in breath-taking Technicolor (I've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in Heaven are in black and white! Niven is a little stiff at times but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help Niven.
The imagery throughout is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence) and the special effects are truly great (considering the age of the film).
There's also a very strange sequence when Niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought provoking film--highly recommended.
This remains unknown in the US which is a shame."""
10884_8	"for a slasher flick,this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre.yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree,people die,yada yada yada.however there are some good positives in this film.first off,i really liked the mask the nut job wore.it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique(although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made)also,the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before,and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept,as far as i know.
i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by Mr sicko,for most of the murders.
the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre,but that'a small concern.
the movie does not take itself seriously,which is something most slashers suffer from.
oddly enough,while watching the movie,i was reminded of the early \Friday the 13th films,which did take themselves seriously.
there are a few concerns about this movie.
in several scenes,the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons.
by this,i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot,and also the way he walked.
of bigger concern,however is a scene very close to the end,where Mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance(actually a complete rip off)of another famous horror titan.
and in the very last scenes,we have our scumbag,once again,looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned.
in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre.
these scenes were weak and unoriginal(obviously).by the way,the movie is set in Australia,so if you're a sucker for a chick with an Aussie accent(like me)you'll be in heaven.if you not,than it just might grate on you.one other great thing about this movie:beautiful Kylie Minogoue(just don't get too attached to her)there is one non Aussie accent,courtesy of Molly Ringwald.overall,there are more reasons to watch than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so,i have to give \""Cut\"" 8/10,which may seem too high to some people."""
8326_7	"While Fred Schepisi's \I.Q.\"" doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing.
Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan).
Probably the funniest scene is when Dr.
Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist.<br /><br />Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point.
It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption).
A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him).<br /><br />So anyway, this one is acceptable.
Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis."""
9525_8	"ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score .
It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen .
As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics.
Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed .
But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is <br /><br />ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances .
I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better .
Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top .
While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career"
6029_7	"There aren't too many times when I see a film and go, \huh, what?\"", but this was one of them.
Maybe after seeing Zabriskie Point I felt much the same way Woody Allen felt after seeing 2001- he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period, realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on.
Michelangelo Antonioni, in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US (after Red Desert, he did Blow-Up, this film, China, and The Passenger, all filmed outside his native Italy), I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium.
The results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images, feelings, tones, colors, sounds, and a visual representation of this era.
\""A director's job is to see\"", Antonioni once stated.
Whatever that means, he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his post-fifties work (I say post-fifties since I've yet to see any of his films from before L'Avventura).<br /><br />What he does lack is a point, at least the kind of point that he could bring in Blow-Up and The Eclipse.
You get the feeling of what is around these characters, what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness, however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose.
Antonioni, coming from the school of hard-knocks, neo-realistic film-making, does do what he can with his mostly non-professional cast (those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters), but the two stars Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin seem as if Antonioni's under-directing them.
Perhaps that was the point.
The story's split into three acts, thankfully not too confusing, as Mark escapes his existence around the boiling, dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's LA area, and Daria is sent out from LA to drive to Phoenix for some business meeting.
They meet by chance as Mark's plane (how does he know how to drive, maybe a little background info there?) and Daria's car meet up, and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert.
Aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene, much of this act isn't terribly interesting.
<br /><br />The two leads are fair enough to look at, but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity? The ideas that come forth (in part from a screenplay co-written by Sam Shepard) aren't too revealing, except for one brief instant where drugs vs.
reality is brought up.
Then the film heads towards the third act, as Mark decides to do the right thing, under disastrous circumstances, and Daria arrives at her boss' place, only to be in full disillusionment (not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film).
Although the film took its time telling its story, I didn't have as much of a problem with that as I did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer.
I understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self-confidence of the \""anti-establishment\"", but maybe Antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself.
In some scenes he as director and editor (and the often astounding cinematography by Alfio Contini) find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground.
Not to say the technical side of Zabriskie Point isn't involving to a degree (this may make some feel drowsy, as Antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say Francis Ford Coppola is).
<br /><br />The deserts, skies, city, and even the faces in close-ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame, bringing us in.
The soundtrack is equally compelling, with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point, and then a crushing, surreal Pink Floyd song (re-titled from 'Careful with that Axe Eugene, one of their best pre-Dark Side) in the explosion sequence.
If only the performances weren't so one-sided I might find this to be on par with Blow-Up or The Eclipse.
It's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand, and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60's.
But hey, what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US, such as say, Italy.
And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing."""
3223_8	"Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence.
You can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot.
Kurt Russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding.
Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!"
11009_7	"There was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups.
It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers.
This film also included one of the most imaginative \escape\"" scenes in recent years.
The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.<br /><br />Although the plotting of the film was convoluted, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed.<br /><br />In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel \""1984\"" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian State, which would control minds and diminish human liberty.
It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the State, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker."""
2715_8	"Q.E.D.
was a brilliant TV series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982.
I am eagerly awaiting its availability on DVD!<br /><br />While it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., all of which I am a huge fan of,Q.E.D.
had a much more intellectual quality to it.
It did not suffer for that, however - the dialog was witty and the action was high.
The show ran in the UK as Mastermind, and it did have something of the BBC feel to it, but with better production values than BBC typically had in that era.<br /><br />I was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially, and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television.

643_10	"Since my third or fourth viewing some time ago, I've abstained from La Maman et la putain while I wait for the DVD.
In the meantime, I've read the french screenplay as well as Alain Philippon's monograph on Jean Eustache.
The latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc, and in-between, impossible to see or, in the cases of Mes petites amoureuses and Le Père Noël..., re-see.<br /><br />A few questions that hit me this moment: Polish Véronika's French is plenty colloquial (un maximum d' \un maximum d'\"").
Even so, does she have an accent? I think I can tell she does.
What does the absence of color add, especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed? How does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of The Tempest and The Winter's Tale? Ditto Alphaville.
We may imagine the elapsed years since have done it, but does Eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu? Is this an enchanted isle? Is Alexandre's a fairy tale? Alexandre's always choreographing himself, worrying about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does.
Or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself? How different is he from Vertigo's Scottie? (I say, I think, very.) What's the difference, and is there one, between Eustache's Léaud, and Truffaut's, and Godard's? How different is the present Léaud? Isn't he still doing it, whatever it is, in recent roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, whatever, approaching old age? Once I arrived early for one in a series of mostly Antoine Doinel (Léaud's character) Truffaut films.
For a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, Léaud hair, with a direction-seeking nose.
I have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry.
I was that age, but have no idea what I myself looked like then.
No scarf, at least.
I do have a brother, though, who seems to have learned his carriage from Bresson."""
11051_8	"\Maléfique\"" is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart.
Its cast doesn't have recognized names, it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect; but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well-written script, an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills.
Eric Valette may not be a well-know name yet, but with \""Maléfique\"", his feature length debut, he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like Jeunet, Gans or Aja.<br /><br />The film is the story of four prisoners in a cell, four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal: to get out.
Carrère (Gérald Laroche) gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi-millionaire fraud; his cell-mates, the violent Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), the intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and the mentally challenged Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), are all convicted for murder and give Carrère a cold welcome.
Their personalities will clash as Carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic.<br /><br />Written by Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier, \""Maléfique\"" is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of Clive Barker's stories.
The movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters, they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities.
The story's supernatural element is very well-handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a Gothic novel.
Despite being a movie about four men locked in a room, the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact, the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust, claustrophobia, and specially, paranoia.<br /><br />Director Eric Valette makes a great use of atmosphere, mood and his cast to give life to the plot.
Despite its obvious lack of budget, he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive.
His subtle and effective camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location, and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot.
The very few displays of special effects are very well-done and Valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore.<br /><br />The characters are what make this film work, and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit.
Gérald Laroche is excellent as Carrère, a man at first sight innocent, but who hides a dark past.
Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are very effective too, specially Rataud in his very demanding role.
However, is Clovis Cornillac who steal the show with his performance as Marcus, a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself.
The characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them.<br /><br />The movie is terrific, but it is not without its share of flaws.
Of course, the most notorious one is its the low-budget.
Some of the CGI-effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make-up and prosthetics used in other scenes, however, it is never too bad for it.
Probably the bad thing about \""Maléfique\"" is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters, not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view.<br /><br />Anyways, \""Maléfique\"" is another one of those great horror films coming out from France lately, and one that deserves to have more recognition.
Valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest (albeit complex) tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities.
Personally, this film is a new favorite.

12356_8	"Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha.
They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women.
I can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are.
The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />I did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting.
I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse.
The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch.
I'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories.
It's a great example of both."
9560_9	"admittedly, I first picked up Ranma 1/2 when I was around twelve.
I was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read.
Then, I went to the Comic/Manga section and spotted this book.
At my first few reads through the chapters I didn't really know what was going on, but I knew that I LOVED it.
I even took it home for a few more reads over.
Frankly, I wasn't getting anywhere.
And then, about five months (I'm 16 now) ago my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this Manga.
I couldn't remember what it was called, but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi, creator of Inu Yasha.
I Googled it, and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes.
At first I was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics, but it didn't really matter in the end.
No anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind, watch again.
I once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day.
I don't know how I did it...
but I couldn't stop.
Eventually, after about two days, I grew obsessed.
I even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching Ranma.
Never have I found a series so enjoyable, so funny, and so heartwarming to watch.
To this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied.
Of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers, but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading.
<br /><br />Ranma 1/2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his dad Genma Saotome.
INTENSE martial artists.
They are so intense, that they went to the ancient training grounds in China and became 'cursed'.
The grounds were full of different pools of springs, and if you land in one, you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water.
For Genma, that was a PANDA, and for Ranma that was a...
girl! It's a very crafty fun loving story.
On top of that, Genma promises his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the Tendo dojo alive.
'Course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual.
Obviously they start to like one another, but both way to stubborn to admit it.
But..
Genma has a history of doing this.
He promised Ranma to many girls.
<br /><br />Trust me.
It's worth watching.
It's humorous, heartwarming and all around amazing."
11122_10	"When we started watching this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be.
Even when you hate a character, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way they do.
It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves.<br /><br />I can't understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher's abuse of her, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior.
Carmella has a dream house, endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not.
That's why I watch.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find something you missed the first five times.
We even watch episodes out of sequence (watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language, A&E with language censored, reruns on the Movie Network) - whenever they're on, we're there.
We've been totally spoiled now.<br /><br />I also love the Malaprop's.

In the past I've watched Rob Estes on \""Suddenly Susan\"" & \""Melrose Place\"" and also Josie Bissett on \""Melrose Place\"" and loved seeing them together again in \""I Do They Don't\"".
They have great chemistry together (I guess being married in real life helps that!) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball.
Of course they stumble, but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about.
So many people have been talking about this movie - all good! - and the movie left us wanting more.
This would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so nice to see a real life, down to earth, family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called \""Reality TV\"" that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days.

7951_10	This is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy.
It's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own.
The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name.
Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound.
Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things.
Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time.
There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all.
It's the best talking animal movie that I've seen so far.
It's a really good movie for families.
3308_8	"The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang-Soo's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case, two), and stories of troubled or troubling relationships, as well as a potent dosage of irony.<br /><br />One thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism.
However, this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein.
The two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with her friends, only to find herself drawn to a stranger, the second about a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes.<br /><br />Again, Hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet I don't think he's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters, drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony.
I think the think I've come to love about Hong's films is that they just feel so real, especially the complex and conflicted characters.
Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but rather, that these characters he and the actors present, feel fully developed and believable.<br /><br />This is not a fast moving film.
There's a lot of lingering and like the previous film, things don't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways.
There doesn't appear to be any element of the film that isn't intentionally placed in the film and it's made my a little hyper-aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses.<br /><br />Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, regret, longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision-making.
It's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row.
Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear.
This film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision.
Great viewing for art cinema lovers.
8/10."
579_10	"In my humble opinion, this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved.
Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance.
I enjoy most of his work, and this was my favorite.
I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it.
My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen.
She gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together.
The movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart, and I was weepy for several days after seeing the movie.
Sometimes love isn't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves.
We see this in our own family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time.
The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- I was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, \But when I am alone in the half light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul, and memories.
And the sounds of the Big Black Foot River, and a four count rhythm, and the hope that a fish will rise.

7088_10	"Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's.
People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness.
Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.<br /><br />The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface.
But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things.
And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity.
With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.<br /><br />I watched this movie once around 10 years ago.
It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important.
I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it.
Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines  almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus.
The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands.
Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up.
Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked.
Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction.
Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly.
One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr.
Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world.
The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace.
Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake.
But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past.
But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.<br /><br />There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him.
The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact.
Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr.
Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance.
The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way.
It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help.
Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.<br /><br />The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain.
Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies.
It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece."

I didn't watch the Italian original so I cannot judge or compare those two movies.
But \""Welcome to Collinwood\"" is great comedy for itself, about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house.
Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast.
Really excellent movie for these actors: Sam Rockwell, William H.
Macy (great), Isaiah Washington, Michael Jeter (great), Luis Guzmán, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Esposito and finally George Clooney gave their share in this project.
<br /><br />Maybe to say that this movie is only comedy, isn't fair.
This is more then that.
Because of one difference.
All of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked: what will they do with their money? It is mostly securing their future in very humble way.
This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals.
And not only them but also cop Babitch, who is presented like corrupted one; so here directors Russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same.
Actually all in Collinwood are; and not only in Collinwood, cause all people chase money, on legal or illegal way.
I don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves.
But, this one is exception.
You have to love them all.
Riley with his little baby and wife in jail.
Toto with his pants.
Cosimo with his line: \""Your mother's a whore!\"" and all others.
They are just like characters in my favorite comic, Alan Ford.
They all trying to make some money, but simply they are out of luck.
But they all did one good deed: they gave money to Riley, so he can get his wife out of prison.
They are all heroes in my eyes, cause lots of \""honest\"" people wouldn't do that."""
7795_9	"This will be a different kind of review.
I've seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there.
It was the first movie I'd seen by Ashley Judd and she was great and I've enjoyed every other thing I've seen her in.
Sundance's reaction made an impression on me too, as did the director, Victor Nunez, who has directed and written several movies about Florida.
This movie speaks to me and I've seen nothing with which to compare it.
The plot speaks less to me than the surroundings.
Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review."
190_10	"I had seen Marion Davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal.
She couldn't dance for peanuts, she didn't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance.
But I hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful.
Rather than kidding her own image, as has been suggested here, to me it seems a satire on Gloria Swanson, who did start off in slapstick comedies, went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a Count.
Marion, a top mimic, also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand, that was Gloria Swanson spot on!!!<br /><br />Colonel Pepper (Dell Henderson) has motored all the way from Georgia to Hollywood, determined to prove that his daughter, Peggy, (Marion Davies) will be the greatest star ever.
Their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet Billy Boone (William Haines) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get Peggy a job.
Peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic.
They convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success.
Charlie Chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesn't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely.
\Who was that short little guy\"" - when she finds out she faints!!! Peggy and Billy get a call from High Art Studio but only Peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way.
There is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't think much of - it's Marion Davies!!!.
<br /><br />She finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress - but she can't cry!!! It is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds, she can't stop!!! Her new leading man, Andre (Paul Ralli) convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated - she even adopts a new name - Patricia Pepoire!!!.
She also seems to have forgotten Billy and her dad - she has developed a \""STAR\"" personality!!! When the slapstick studio picks the same location as \""Patricia's\"" movie, Billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude.
When she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew.
<br /><br />After a studio luncheon ( a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day) \""Patricia\"" gets a call from the Boss.
It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old Peggy back.
She and Andre decide to get married, she dreams of being a Countess (even though Billy says that Andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a Count than he is).
On her wedding day, Billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that Billy is the one for her.<br /><br />It was amazing to see all the guest stars - John Gilbert is seen going through the MGM gates, Lew Cody is talking to Elinor Glynn, who not only wrote \""It\"" but several racy romances that were made into MGM movies.
William Haines, another actor whose movies I had always wanted to see, was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing.
Harry Gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director - there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and Marion was at the top of them all - I'm giving this film 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended."""
4285_10	"This \tragicomedy\"" written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category.
And yet, its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value.
A masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed).<br /><br />In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade, a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour.
Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real-life performance).
<br /><br />The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an insight into nation's collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can, hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy.
Using a simple movie language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy.
<br /><br />Brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: \""Maratonci trce pocasni krug\"", \""Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota\"", and my other director's favourite \""Davitelj protiv davitelja\"")."""
1301_10	"I've loved all of Cream's work, even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold.
Even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples) still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today.
This power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their Royal Albert Hall shows last year.
They may have gotten older, as have their fans, but the energy is still there, with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own.
The renditions of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, not one seems to miss a beat.
Clapton's solos have a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band.
Ginger Baker, enough said.
Jack Bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that Clapton could never get on his own.
Bottom line, if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year (well, some may have seen them), it's all on this DVD, with cool special features."
4133_7	"An incredible little English film for so many reasons.
First it's a rare look a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy.
While his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister.
Historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot.
Being English it didn't have the big budget of the Hollywood films of the same era and it often shows, but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an England that would soon be gone.
When we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest American counter part `It Happened One Night' were in their day as risqué as `Fatal Instinct' was in our time.
But after watching and enjoying this movie the first time I can't help but feel sadness when I watch it today.
With half of film shoot before 1950 gone, saving the remaining films means hard choices, and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important.
The color shifting, lack of contrast, and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking.
This movie along with `It Happened One Night' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch, or better yet why not a double feature."
2115_10	"After seeing You've Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, The Shop Around the Corner.
I was amazed at this movie.
It's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times.
The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, I wish to urge you to see it today.
I'm not against re-makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic.
Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!"
8342_7	"Fairly good romantic comedy in which I don't think I've ever seen Meg looking any cuter.
All the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp.
Of course, in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey, but that is why I love romantic comedies....one can just totally forget reality and have a good time.
Nice film.
Damn, Meg is a babe, eh?"
5766_10	"Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect, I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time.
I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies, and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too.
I also have a soft spot for people who are trying, sometimes against all odds, to live a dream.
And again, these people are doing it.
Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film? No.
Not even close.
But for what they do on their meager budgets, these films should be recommended.
For me, the bottom line is always, was I entertained? Did I have a good time with this movie? And here the answer to both was \Yes.\"" The first in the series is also the most raw.
It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something.
Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site.
Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility.
They get rescued, but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole.
Soon, the whole town is overtaken by the undead.
And these zombies are fun.
They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever, but they are fun.
The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead, with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever! Pretty cheesy, but I think it was meant to be.
Still, it moves very fast, has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style.
The acting is uneven, but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track.
I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie.
Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this, his first film, but also has no delusions.
He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to people involved.
Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field.
The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well.
I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for.
There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV.
Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't.
While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren't fun! Overall, this is a solid, if a bit flawed, release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter.
While not breaking any grand rules of move making, I found the series to be fun and always a laugh, so I give this set a solid recommendation.
Todd Sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks, he was trying, sometimes against all odds it seems, to make fun zero budget, splattery horror and to that end, he has succeeded in spades."""
4676_9	"I found this movie thought-provoking, and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick-fix films where we are manipulated into loving the \good guy\"" and hating the \""bad guy.\"" Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history.
Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.<br /><br />When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director.<br /><br />This is a fitting successor to the classic \""Ordinary People.\"" I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!"""
1628_10	"This is bar none the most hilarious movie I have ever seen.
Beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to Wienberg Military Academy, a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film, and it does not let up for a second.<br /><br />It's tough trying to describe this film; the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy.
But it is oh so much more than that! Fresh from the minds of those folks over at MAD Magazine, Up the Academy serves up a formula and style that I have never since seen duplicated by ANY of the \funniest\"" offerings to come out of Hollywood in years past.
Basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year olds themselves.
See this movie if you love to act \""immature.\"" A classic.

11561_10	"This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters.
Especially, of course, the two leading characters.
Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer.
So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails.
Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an untidy, unreliable sports-reporter who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in a bachelor apartment.
He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment.
And soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can't live together for a long time.
Felix turns Oscar's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat.
He cleans and cooks the whole time.
After a short while, Oscar feels persecution mania ...
Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted.
Above all, Jack Lemmon's play is wonderful.
He is the perfect clown.
He makes us laugh but in a tragi-comic way.
Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper, because Oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling-ball.
While he is preparing the drinks, Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living-room.
To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts to talk about the weather.
A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children.
Suddenly he begins to weep and when Oscar comes back with the drinks, there are three weeping people in the living-room.
The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes.
An intelligent, entertaining comedy with much heart.
10 out of 10!"
11043_7	"Malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere.
Nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest.
Soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell.
From here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison.
That leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light.<br /><br />Honestly I think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together.
Anyway I was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast.
The kills are raw and eerie...
its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in Hellraiser.
Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint.
At times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger...
when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on Marcus breasts it seems normal, so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be? With its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do.
I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale.
Several elements like the visitor with the camera, the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story.
Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director Valette, although its a turn-off to see he's is doing a Hollywood remake of \One missed call\"" which was worn off and useless already in the Miike-version."""
11152_10	"Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing.
I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since.
<br /><br />Everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences.
<br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one.
Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools.
<br /><br />10/10"
2272_7	"Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut's dark tale.
Notle plays Howard W.
Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II.
After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past.
As with much of Vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims.
Nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past.
(7 out of 10)"
12426_7	"David Duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in Californication - the troubled talent.
And it is a role he plays well.<br /><br />This thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end.
Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts.
The story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted.
Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mix a heady cocktail.
Unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the FBI is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene.
But, that aside, a movie worth seeing."
345_7	"The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least.
However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced.
Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie.
The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist').
In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it.
The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore."
11180_7	"Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea.
When people read the book, they automatically start making their own \mental movie\"" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress.
And everybody's mind's-eye opus is different, which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out, you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.
<br /><br />All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.
<br /><br />There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King.
When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING; the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS).
<br /><br />Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book, that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings.
For that, we have music video-turned-film director Mary Lambert to thank, (she also directed SIESTA, not exactly a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list), working from a screenplay by the 'Man-ster' Himself, and probably one of his better ones.
<br /><br />Since the majority of you know the story, I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details.
Dr.
Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country.
Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back.
Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well, even if you haven't read the book, do the frickin' math.
It IS a King story, after all, so no mystery where this is headed.
<br /><br />It's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way.
Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery, scream-inducing life here: Rachel Creed's (STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip into the \""other\"" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery.
And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse.<br /><br />Good performances by all here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: \""Sometimes, dead is better.
\""<br /><br />About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son, Gage (Miko Hughes).
Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this, Lambert and crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to \""sell\"" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie.
This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up, though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged, (especially Gwynne's death scene.)<br /><br />Other than that, everything else is still about as good as it gets.
CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five.<br /><br />Still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now."""
12040_7	"A young solicitor from London, Arthur Kidd is sent to a small coastal town of Crythin Gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow Mrs Drablow.
While attending her funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention.
Supposedly Drablow lived a reclusive life, and locals kept pretty quiet about her.
After this he heads to Mrs Drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide.
There he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house, and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes.
Now can Mrs Drablow's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help Kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about.<br /><br />Often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and I can see their point.
But only in doses does it draw upon tag.
Yes, from what you can gather I was left a 'little' under-whelmed, despite really liking it.
I was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature, but that's probably it expecting.
Mainly I had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller 'The Changeling'.
When you hear so many good things, it's sometimes hard not get caught up with it.<br /><br />Anyhow what the British TV presentation of \The Woman in Black\"" effectively does is bring out a truly old-fashion, slow burn spine-tingling premise driven by its moody locations, disquieting atmosphere and first-rate performances.
Subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story (adapted off Susan Hill's novel of the same name), as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist.
Little seems to happen, and can feel drawn out, but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard.
Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black.
Who mostly appears as a background figure, it's ultimately creepy.
She might not appear all that much, but when she does.
Talk about unnerving! That also goes for that downbeat conclusion.
Pauline Moran, who plays the woman in black, competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning.
A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you.
She's a spirit you don't want to cross paths with, yet alone let her see you.
An accomplished performance by a marvelously moody Adrian Rawlins as the solicitor Arthur Kidd does hold it all together.
In support are solid turns by Bernard Hepton, David Daker, Clare Holman and David Ryall.<br /><br />Drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn, time-worn Victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear.
Director Herbert Wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well-judged contriving.
Instead of going out to shock us, some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won't let go.
The sound effects are masterfully used, by surrounding and disorienting the air.
Rachel Portman's harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you.<br /><br />This rarity made-for-television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook-fest.
It might not share much new to the sub-genre, but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse."""
11333_9	"Just kidding about the weight loss thing; well, you might lose weight you never know.
Anyway, what can I say, I love this film.
It has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies.
Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them.
The film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery, and horror they perceive.
Jake's Closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with.
Watch it with friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional."
10407_8	"The story-line of \The Thief of Bagdad\"" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.
The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas.
He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffar's deeds and hate him.
He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief.
The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.
There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by.
Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.
He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss.
Then he is captured.
When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog.
Jaffar then asks for the Princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra.
The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog.
The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.
So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her.
He does awaken her.
She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard.
She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmad's sight and turn Abu back into a thief.
The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island.
Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle.
Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again.
For freeing him, he gets three wishes.
His first is for sausages.
In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death.
Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad.
The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the All-Seeing eye.
Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue.
Abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees Ahmad in a canyon.
He has the genie take him to Ahmad.
Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.
She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.
Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad.
Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the 'eye'.
Abu finds himself in the \""Land of Legend\"", where the old men who rule want to make him their king.
He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess.
The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution.
Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him.
Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be.
This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda.
The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography.
The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating.
The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes.
The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar.
Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power.
June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan.
As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role.
This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also.
Its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements.
This is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over."""
6632_7	"Of course, he did have to INVENT EVERYTHING about cinematography, film directing, etc.
before he could make classics like \The Gardner,\"" so I suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary.
Today we call them \""home movies,\"" and they are just as boring now as this one is"""
1290_7	"Yeah, I remember this one! Many years since I actually watched it.
The story was entirely surreal, but nonetheless great! What anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at.
It's the same with \First Kid\"", which follows a similar pattern.
Certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense.
Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer.
Of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay.
I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was funny, had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story.
Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway."""
4598_9	This is one of Jackies best films that is him without opera buddies Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with Jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy
12447_8	"There's a great deal of material from the Modesty Blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie.
Unfortunately, several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character.
So, no, this isn't the Modesty you know from the comic strip (currently reprinted in nice editions from Titan Books).
This is Modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip, and from what you can piece together from her back-story, it's accurate.<br /><br />Miramax had the movie rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser.
Early drafts of the Miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels, but always managed to leave out some crucial element.
Tarantino wasn't happy with any of them, and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed.
To the studio's credit, they wanted to keep him in the process, since they knew he \got\"" the character and her world.
With the movie rights close to expiration, they decided to try a very different approach.
The result was \""My Name is Modesty,\"" a small direct-to-video movie that introduces the character.<br /><br />The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald.
These characters are important to Blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories.
What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself.
She never loses her composure, and you never doubt that she's in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns.
Most of the movie takes place within a casino, which undoubtedly saved money on the production.
It doesn't matter.
The film does not come across as cheap.
Instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and believable) back-story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead.
Should Miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now, they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her \""origin.\"" I realize the words \""Direct-to-Video\"" don't inspire confidence, but this film is well worth a look."""
11969_10	"I loved this show growing up and I still watch the first season DVD at age 19 today.
What can I say? I grew up in a house much like the one on Full House.
I had a dad, two sisters, and a dog.
I guess the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend.
Also, I grew up with my mom in the house.
I don't know what I would have done without Full House on television.
I think that Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J.
(played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace), and Michelle (Played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters.
I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family like Steph, I am a younger sister like Michelle, and I am an older sister like D.J.
I really like how the show always has moral values because I don't really like any of the O.C.-like shows today.
I like the comedy of Full House, too.
Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier), and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the girls' uncle, dad's friend, and dad, respectively.
The story goes that, after the girls' mom dies, Danny's best friend Joey and his brother-in-law, Jesse move in to help raise the kids.
Three men trying to raise three young girls=hilarious.
Each character on Full House is full of heart, funny, and genuinely believable.
Joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul.
Jesse is the cool, motorcycle riding, tough-guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces, and later, his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, from Summerville).
Both kids and adults will love this show.
Guaranteed."
43_10	I liked this movie a lot.
It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends over such a tragedy.
Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot.
My only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things.
Other than that it was great.
3125_10	"The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment.
Here's my take:<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum has it all.
We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything.
He has been running for too long.
This time, it ends.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer.
Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date.
He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.<br /><br />There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense.
The reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on.
(or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping.
The audience was loving it.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package.
All of the goods and then some.
This is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.<br /><br />The Last Word: Excellent conclusion.
The best of the trilogy.
This is how summer movie thrillers should be done.
I love the Bourne trilogy."
5293_8	"This is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called Pecker because he use to Peck at his Food.
Pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md., and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from New York City.
Pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag.
There are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey's with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same.
It is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film, but who cares, it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998."
8093_7	"My friend had the idea of watching the animated LOTR after seeing the Peter Jackson Return of The King.
So I finally bought it off e-bay, thinking right from the start it was going to suck.
Actually, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who did the voice for Frodo sounded somewhat like Elijah Wood.<br /><br />Not the greatest adaptation of a book, but trust me, I've seen a lot worse.
It skips quite a lot of things, since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into one two hour movie.
Definatley worth a watch, kids might like, but still, absoutley no comparision with the Peter Jackson trilogy."
18_7	"`Stanley and Iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life.
Stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write.
Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley.
She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time.
Over time they become romantically involved.
After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him.<br /><br />It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films.
A good film all round.

6560_7	"I think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films.
<br /><br />This is not a bad movie - it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns.
I don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment.
<br /><br />What makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of which are black, one Asian, and a Mexican/Hispanic character.
<br /><br />These aren't your usual western women--they're tough--they can draw fast and shoot straight.
<br /><br />They're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey.
<br /><br />The plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns--in the vein of \you shot my brother--so I'm gonna get you!\"" Only in this western, a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it.
<br /><br />So she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days.
<br /><br />One of them, Maria, is not really all that interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but she is motived by the fact there's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they're headed.
<br /><br />There are a couple of scenes that don't quite make sense, not that they interfere that much, they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there.
So the film could use a little tightening, but over all, this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is.
<br /><br />My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain--of the \""heroines\"", one is obviously straight, the others sexual orientations are never disclosed.<br /><br />7 Stars"""

Many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see.
The above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre.<br /><br />It has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself.

Erika Christensen was good but Busy stole the show.

The second season began where the first ended, with much mystery.
Suspense in most, if not all episodes and mystery everywhere.
One that made me think and think again.
It's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful.
Never fail to excites and I am looking forward to the new season.
Hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time, more mystery to be solved.
Good selection of cast too for this show, fit the characters perfectly.
Really can't wait to finally discover the secret.
Hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending."

The writing was fantastic, and the characters were all rich, and simple.
It's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them.
The creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer sucked right into their world.
Further, the music is terrific.
They employed some independents to do the score, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie.
If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (like I did), I highly recommend that you go see it.
Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie.

But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such.

Nevertheless, they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.

1721_8	"Had this movie been made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score.
However, for 1909, this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today.
Just don't try to compare this silent film to later silents--the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century don't look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond.
<br /><br />This movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most films back then) and is a variation of the Edgar Allen Poe story, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.
While many are familiar with the story, I won't elaborate further as I don't want to ruin the film.
Just suffice to say that it's very creepy!!"
4737_7	"Hak hap(Black Mask)is what I'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions.
Sure the plot has been tried and heard before, (A biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist, and a librarian.
But when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police -his best friend is a cop- he becomes the black mask.) the style that the movie goes for, very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining.
I love martial arts movies that are a spectical.
People flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop.
But that is what this movie is about anyway right, a showcase of Jet Li doing what he does best, and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills, which to say the least are top notch.
As with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala.
Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time, these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats.
But I must say, even with the large holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape? Who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment.......ohh well suspension of belief I guess) , the movie to me stays interesting.
It is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter.
But still all around a great high paced action movie."
2779_7	"To \Bend It Like Beckham\"" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to \""Hit it Like Bonds\"" or \""Dunk it Like Jordan.\"" Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham.
Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother.
However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team.
After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of.
The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents.
There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian.
The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light.
The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience.
Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult."""
542_9	"When I first found out that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch.
It took me weeks to realize that I've seen the original of this and loved it.
So I had even more reason to watch.
Well, I watched.
It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies.
I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and I didn't like most of the characters, Brian's one included.
But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more.
At the end, I was cheering for Stanley and his own happy ending.
If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, I'd suggest you watch this."
1637_10	"I love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years.
It does get better with every viewing.
I agree with all of the positive reviews here.
Yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days.
I found myself doing commentary as I watched it.
Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast.
I couldn't disagree more.
He is brilliant as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse.
Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter).
Lilia Skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma.
Also a star is the stark Montana prairie.
It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle.
There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary.
No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script.
Once you see Heartland, you'll never forget it.
It deserves all the 10s it gets here."
10858_8	"enjoyed the movie and efficient Confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society.
I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big D was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long.
I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest.
On thing that always amuses me about HK films is that the main influence the British seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone, they are still there."

All the good guys are good, all the bad guys are bad, and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics.<br /><br />Warren Beatty, as Dick Tracy, is the ultimate tough guy straight man, incorruptable, calm usually, always a better fighter than the other guy, and rarely one to push the limit on legality.
Al Pacino, as \Big Boy\"" Caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters.
Maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best, Breathless Mahoney, a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going.
Gleanne Headly is Tracy's tough-talking, fiercely independent long-time girlfrined.
And then there's The Kid, a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in, who models himself after his surrogate father, and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up.<br /><br />The supporting players are a Who's Who of character actors.
Charles Durning is the chief of police.
Dick Van Dyke is the District Attorney, who's bribed by Big Boy's goons to keep him on the streets.
Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles, the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say.
R.G.
Armstrong is Pruneface, one of the rival gangsters Big Boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city.
Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys, the piano player for Breathless's show.
Paul Sorvino plays Lips Manlis, Breathless's former benefactor until Big Boy gives him \""the Bath.\"" James Caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with Big Boy's grand plan.
William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy's enforcers, Flattop and Itchy.<br /><br />This movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip, plus it is full of vibrant colors.
Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds.
All the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie--and then some! The matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional, only acted in three-dimensional sets.
The humor is plentiful.
Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since.
Big Boy is kind of crazy, and kind of self-pitying.
He's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our Founding Fathers and likening himself to great political leaders.
The man with the plan, always looking for the smartest way to do business."""
11422_8	"Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film.
The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction.
However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient.
For example, a central theme in the story is young France's inability to form strong relationships with others.
Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly, notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France's return to her childhood home, the girl's lack of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development (or lack thereof) as a protagonist.
The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot.
The film raises a great deal of tension between characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied.
The final few scenes are powerful but depressing.
Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint, but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice."
7107_10	"You can call it a mystery, perhaps a small thriller, or an intelligent film.<br /><br />The story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and is looking to regain it.<br /><br />I have to say I was quite surprised that I truly did enjoy this film.
It is not usually the genre I care for however the characters quickly became people to me and I wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to them.<br /><br />Just like many french films over English made, we are able to learn much more about the character and the affect of their surroundings on their person.
This film is character driven and will not disappoint!"
10392_10	"This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure.
The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene.
Romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be.
I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy I wished was true."
10273_8	"I'm a big fan of films where people get conned, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre.
In short, it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing what's happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen.
The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it's still difficult to guess where it's going, and every twist comes off as a surprise.
As mentioned, I'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler.
She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.<br /><br />House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city.
The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill.
Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece.
Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role.
She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act.
The way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer.
At times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film.
Another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks, say.
All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride."
10940_10	"This is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever, and may be one of the best movies ever...
It's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle, with lots of intrigue and suspense.
This film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions, with people hiding their identities and their natures.
The characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters.
They are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality's and desires.<br /><br />The fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting.
It has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy.
There are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal.
The styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film...
When this happens, The director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel.
These cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely.<br /><br />One thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death.
The director Chang Cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death.
This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective.
We actually care when people are killed in this film.
This is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed.
Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching.
When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain.<br /><br />At the same time, this is also a fun movie.
It has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film.
There is bad dubbing, The characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat.
Some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic...
all this just adds to the greatness of the film.<br /><br />And lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries.
If you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic.
Everything goes by so fast (because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre) that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is.
The lighting and composition are spectacular at times.
The camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing...
In the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example, imagine Hitchcock moving at about twice the speed.
Chang Cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it's confines.
He doesn't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film, but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work.
He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people.<br /><br />This is the real package A kung fu movie that delivers on every level.
It's art, it's trash, it's emotionally moving, and it's fun, it has a true sense of morality, but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action.
I recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not."
2802_10	"As someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed \Bend It Like Beckham\"".
But I gotta say, this was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'm going to say it the British - and international - way) and just adore football player David Beckham.
But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie).
Okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of \""bend\"" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd also never heard of David Beckham prior to this movie).

5644_8	"When the US entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to churn out propaganda films.
THE LITTLE American is probably the best of the lot because it stars Mary Pickford.<br /><br />Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist.<br /><br />When the ship Pickford is sailing on is sunk by the Germans (think Lusitania) because it is carrying munitions, Pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the German commander.
Later on, of course, she runs into both Holt and Hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a château.<br /><br />Director Cecil B.
DeMille provides one truly great scene in this film as Pickford and Holt are wandering through a bombed-out village.
They pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing.
Against the wall is a very large crucifix.
As they stand and watch, the wall collapses but the Jesus figure remains, suspended in mid air.
It's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy.<br /><br />Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch.
She was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm-waving histrionics many other actors of the day used.
She's also very very pretty.
Holt is very good here in a leading-man role.
Hatton is OK.

7454_10	"** Warning - this post may contain spoilers **<br /><br />I only got a Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, the decent Agent Under Fire and the dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent.
The next game I planned to get was Everything or Nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had.
I have to say, he was right.
<br /><br />I bought this for a tenner in HMV, and when I got home, I slammed it in to my Cube and played it for hours on end.
It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline.
Graphics were some of the best I have seen (but now that the XBOX 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man).
The storyline was clever; mad man (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, named as Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which at the start of the game, you, James Bond, have to destroy on a train.
The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's boobs.
You then have to thwart their plans and save the world.<br /><br />The great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as Cleese voicing Q.
There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky.<br /><br />Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10<br /><br />I give this game a grand total of 90%"

11742_9	"\Why did they make them so big? Why didn't they just give the money to the poor?\"" The question about cathedrals was asked by a student to Mr.
Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral.
\""That's a good question,\"" he replied.
\""Partly to inspire them - to get them to look up with awe.\"" I'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone, but this movie certainly had that impact on me.
It was awesome! <br /><br />It didn't start out that way.
For a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of - well - a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral.
If you've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it.
You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day, the bus driver who's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control.
Been there, done that, got the t-shirt was my initial reaction.
I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students.
YAWN! But it turns out to be so much more! Timothy Spall was brilliant as Mr.
Harvey - a sombre, unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals.
Over the course of the movie, his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story.
We also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably Helen, also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press, who's into self-mutilation.<br /><br />This isn't a religious movie, but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes.
When Harvey's colleague Jonathon (played by Ben Miles) says \""I don't care what anyone believes as long as they don't try to force it on anyone else\"" Harvey replies, \""that isn't tolerance - it's indifference!\"" - which is, in fact (in my opinion) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society.
There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters, and the final scene of the movie was brilliant.
As Harvey climbs back on the bus, director Susanna White has the camera slowly pan upwards, so that the final shot is simply of the sky - hearkening back to Harvey's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe.
The cathedral accomplishes its goal.
We look up into the universe in awe, seeking something greater than ourselves, however we choose to define it.
This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie.

9767_7	"Oh, boy, God bless the 1970's, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and now, Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure.
This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me.
My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money.
What the heck? It's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children.<br /><br />Whenever Marcella leaves the room, Raggedy Ann, along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life.
On Marcella's birthday, a new doll, Babette, arrives from Paris, France to the United States of America.
Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home.
However, the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her.
Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone.
Out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely.
After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel, he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge of a cliff, into a deep pit.
In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full.
The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me, it just gets weirder from this point on.<br /><br />While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie, this was actually pretty creative.
Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it, you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure.
This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too.
As scared as I was, I have to admit I'm glad I watched it, sometimes you need a \WTF?!\"" movie to spice up your selection, believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me.
It's official, that doll is just plain creepy, let's just put it this way, there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother, a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.

5502_10	"Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of Media.
The importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man Chavez is.
It is really to demonstrate the way the Bolivarians saw how it happened, the Chavez way of seeing it.
Although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film , I think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate.
The Venezuelian people via the private media corporation of Venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup, the Neo-Liberal side.
This movie shows us the way the Bolivarians saw it .
Call it propaganda , I say it's a judgment call on your part."
11872_10	"Many people like this movie and many more love it, but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons.
Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is.<br /><br />Many people say the acting was over-the-top, but who better to do an over-the-top character than Al Pacino.
To say that Pacino went over-the-top in here would be an understatement.
Yet he does it so well, he just brings the inner devil out of you so well.
His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level; an inhumane level.
Sure at times Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all.
The supporting cast served its job very well.
Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played.
On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best, still he is Steven Bauer.
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and like Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role very well.
Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell.
Other than Pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances.
Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there.
They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.<br /><br />Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this movie.
Whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and I will certainly give De Palma that.
Brian De Palma, though not given the respect, is a very versatile director by my count.
He knows how to direct movies according to their genres, but that at times has not turned out well.
In here it does, this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of De Palma.<br /><br />The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone.
When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised.
That is a testament to him though.
I have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with Scarface.
Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone.<br /><br />The music was good but not that great.
It is certainly not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder.
The music was a little bit too 80s-ish for me but it didn't annoy me.
The cinematography was good, not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this.<br /><br />This has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons.
People should realize that the character of Tony Montana is no hero, he is a monster.
He is not inspiring in anyway.
He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and self consumed.
Yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster.
A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface.<br /><br />The good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the Tony Montanas' are not the real problem.
If we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't.
In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society.
He is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it.
The Tony Montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society.
This in no way excuses people like him.
Instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer.
I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie, it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect."

3666_9	"As essential a part of British pop culture as the Monty Python and James Bond, Doctor Who was a massive hit for 26 years (1963-1989), making it one of the longest running TV shows in the world (most serials are lucky to have ten seasons).
Plans to reboot the series were always on the BBC's agenda, and after a miscalculated (not to mention Americanized) TV movie produced by Fox failed to capture the magic of the original version, another nine years (Comic Relief spoof and animated mini-series notwithstanding) were required before the ultimate Time Lord could return properly, courtesy of acclaimed writer Russell T.
Davies.<br /><br />Davies' brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider: Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a London-based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic.
She is rescued by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and then disappears after quipping: \Nice to meet you, Rose.
Run for your life!\"".
As she gets more and more curious about this \""man\"", she soon finds herself in a whole new world: aliens, invasions, travel through time and space, and of course, the omnipresent Police Box-shaped TARDIS.<br /><br />The first 45 minutes of the new Doctor Who are almost perfect (the special effects could have used a bit more polishing) because Davies nails two things: the show's unique humor and the two protagonists.
The original series' most endearing trait was its blend of spectacular sci-fi and pure British comedy, a hybrid that's hard, if not impossible, to export.
Here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between Rose and the Doctor, who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode.
Okay, so technically Eccleston's Doctor is the Ninth to use that name, but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a Northern accent (the one he uses on a daily basis) and justifying it with a terrific line: \""Lots of planets have a North!\"".
<br /><br />The real triumph of this episode, though, is Piper's performance: in theory, Rose is in her late teens, therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the Doctor before.
Her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new, exciting universe, represents the new generation's reaction to the return of a TV icon, and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and Eccleston is a sign indicating the new Doctor Who is just as good as the old one.
<br /><br />First, fifth, ninth, it makes no difference: there may have been others before Eccleston (and Piper, for that matter) but together he, William Hartnell, Peter Davison and the rest of the bunch are one single character, one so cool he doesn't even need a name: he's THE Doctor."""

That means that it has big, creepy castles, a headstrong young woman, a mysterious older man, hints of horror and the supernatural, and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term.
It also means that it is very deliberately paced, and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement.
If you love films like Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), but you also have a taste for late 1960s/early 1970s Spanish and Italian horror, you may love Blood Castle, as well.<br /><br />Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quiney) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional, unspecified European village.
The locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman, she soon after ends up dead--the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them.
This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women.
At the beginning of the film, yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr.
Ivanna Rakowsky (Erna Schürer) has appeared in the center of the village, asking to be taken to Baron Dalmar's castle.
She's an out-of-towner who has been hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry.
Of course, no one wants to go near the castle.
Finally, Ivanna finds a shady individual (who becomes even shadier) to take her.
Once there, an odd woman who lives in the castle, Olga (Cristiana Galloni), rejects Ivanna and says that she shouldn't be there since she's a woman.
Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay.
She ends up staying, but somewhat reluctantly.
The Baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns, which the Baron's brother, Igor, is suffering from.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Baron's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre, blackish liquid.
And furthermore, Ivanna is having bizarre, hallucinatory dreams.
Just what is going on at the castle? Is the Baron responsible for the crimes? Is he insane? <br /><br />I wanted to like Blood Castle more than I did.
As I mentioned, the film is very deliberate in its pacing, and most of it is very understated.
I can go either way on material like that.
I don't care for The Haunting (yes, I'm in a very small minority there), but I'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s European horror.
One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava.
I also love Dario Argento's work from that period.
But occasionally, Blood Castle moved a bit too slow for me at times.
There are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of Ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle.<br /><br />But the atmosphere of the film is decent.
Director José Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations, and they're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola.
However, Blood Castle feels relatively low budget, and this is a Roger Corman-produced film, after all (which usually means a low-budget, though often surprisingly high quality \quickie\"").
So while there is a hint of the lushness of Bava's colors and complex set decoration, everything is much more minimalist.
Of course, it doesn't help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that's been left out in the sun too long.
It appears \""washed out\"", with compromised contrast.<br /><br />Still, Merino and Di Cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals.
For example, a scene of Ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that's shot from an exaggerated angle, and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only.
There are also a couple Ingmar Bergmanesque shots, where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships, besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame.<br /><br />The performances are fairly good, and the women--especially Schürer--are very attractive.
Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity.
Schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres, with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman's Prison (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude for Your Killer (1975) and Erotic Exploits of a Sexy Seducer (1977).
Blood Castle is much tamer, but in addition to the nudity, there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage, and of course the scenes mixing sex and death.<br /><br />The primary attraction here, though, is probably the story, which is much a slow-burning romance as anything else.
The horror elements, the mystery elements, and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses, but in the end, Blood Castle is a love story, about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms (often with physical threats or harms) to be together."""

IN fact they speak different languages.
BUt when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage's to Mecca, the conversations finally take place.
they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts.<br /><br />This movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers, and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals.
The imagery throughout is impressive, especially the final scenes in Mecca.
It underlines for me once again how much different the world can be, but also at the same time, how similar.
The same was true for the father and son in this film.<br /><br />See this movie.

6323_7	"\Welcome to Collingwood\"" offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory.
Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of, was the 1958 Italian film \""Big Deal on Madonna Street\"", directed by Mario Monicelli.
<br /><br />The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film.
Anything with William H.
Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, in it, can't be bad.
Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine.<br /><br />The film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell.
No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake.
Whatever could go wrong, and more, is what they succeed in doing.
George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these small time crooks do their thing.
Let their funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end!"""
11130_9	"Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies.
As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso.
<br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight.
I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels.
<br /><br />Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself.
I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines \loser\""), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else.
<br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape."""

we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like \Dark Remains\"".<br /><br />We managed to catch a screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005.
The audience loved it and I believe it ended up winning the award for the best film.<br /><br />While it may not have the budget or star power of studio films, it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category.
The acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view.
The story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares.<br /><br />The editing and visual fx are also top notch.
And while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit, the score for \""Dark Remains\"" only adds to it's creepiness.<br /><br />I know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals, but none have been near me, so I can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on DVD.

12052_9	"I saw this on TV so long ago that I can't remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest, most unnerving films I've ever seen.
There is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so that you feel (like the solicitor hero), unsure whether its just imagination or not.
It is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching.
\Production values\"" be hanged, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, locations/sets, music, attention to detail, and ...imagination.

9539_7	"For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you! There is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film, also the effects can be impressionable and awesome.
The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days.<br /><br />Also notable are the little aliens, who I found cute.
All in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre.
Also recommended are films such as Tetsuo:The Iron Man and Versus for that weird Japanese film approach, filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed.
Of course, seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two."
3397_10	"Soylent Green IS...a really good movie, actually.<br /><br />I never would've thought it.
I don't really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts.
He's one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time.
I prefer more vulnerable heroes.
And indeed, he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green, too, but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I don't really mind.<br /><br />I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie.
Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973), and it's lacking in action.
But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt, and highly stratified society, and I was so pleased to see that Edward G.
Robinson had such a moving, funny final role.
Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie.<br /><br />The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to.
Funny, isn't it, to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie..."
7806_10	"\Cry Freedom\"" is not just a movie.
It is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history.
Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid.
The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main \""influencee\"", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one.
But, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa.
\""Cry Freedom\"" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot.
It is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future.
Because of this importance, \""Cry Freedom\"" is an amazing film that should be seen by all."""
1688_9	"This movie is just plain silly.
Almost every scene has some bit of humor: running gags, slapstick, and great jokes.

It's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but that's good thing, too much has a laughter-track to it, and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh, it's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all.
I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character.

11047_9	"I'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in England, but was in many ways very pleased when I finally saw it.
There are a lot of great things to the film, for a start the acting.
Its not something I have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work.
This and the constantly gripping and interesting script, with a nice sorta Lovecraftian feel to it, give the film a real solid backbone.
Add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner.
It has my favorite kind of gore too, supernatural and splattery.
Also, the characters of Marcus, the angry bodybuilding transsexual and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover/plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times, and give a far out, anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent Freudian overtones.
This is one of the most impressive recent horror movies, far more shocking or out there than anything Hollywood can produce.
My only gripe was that I wanted the ending to be darker in tone, but it still works, so on the whole I'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs."
7009_10	"I thought this was a wonderful movie.
It touches every fiber of a human being.
The love in the film is very intense.
I thought it was Will's best performance to date.
Great directing.
Liked the editing.
Music was great.
Good use of flashback.
This is the kind of movie everyone should go see.
I hope people will get something wonderful from this.
Overall, excellent movie.
I think Hollywood should make more movies with substance.
Even action films can have a caring story.
I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting.
He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see.
I would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about.
For me, I found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film.
The outside world was suspended for a moment.
It was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world.
And with this me generation it was great to see something(someone) that cared about other people more than himself."
6588_9	"After viewing several episodes of this series, I have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality.
Here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only -almost - make it work.<br /><br />The dialog is good! The male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions.
Most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side-kick.
And most of the episode plots come across as palatable.
So what could be wrong? How about the, the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them.
<br /><br />The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader.
Why, I ask, why?<br /><br />The episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen.
These actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles, and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments.
A blind person could tell.
Just listen to them talk.
They deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom.
Who would believe these women are Phd scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors?<br /><br />In a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild, guess who they'll choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers for it.
Too bad!"
11186_7	"In the trivia section for Pet Sematary, it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories, Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out.
One wonders what he would've brought to the film, as the director Mary Lambert, while not really a bad director, doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel, of which he wrote the screenplay.
There are of course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda, likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film), and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect.
But something feels missing at times, some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere, which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...) 
<br /><br />As mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie, to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel).
And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone.
And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek.
But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure Creed, and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all.
<br /><br />In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool Ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining.
For the most part it's a very polished directing job, though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script.
If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period.
But it doesn't add up like it could, or should.
Still, it makes for a nifty little midnight movie."

887_10	"French film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary, everyday suburban life.
This was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of L'Emploi du temps ( Time Out ) , a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job.
As is the penchant of French filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places, giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet L'Emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a Swiss mountain retreat ).
Running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive French production, Jacques Audiard's gritty crime caper, Sur mes levres ( Read My Lips ).
Actually, to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that.
As with the earlier French release, it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them.
In a Paris construction firm Carla, a shy, diminutive young woman sits at her desk, sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.
<br /><br />Obnoxious coworkers use the front of Carla's desk to chat and drop off their half-finished Styrofoam cups of coffee.
Partially deaf, Carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome, be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby.
When her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load, Carla fears she may lose her job.
At the employment office Carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant (preferably male) as if she were at a Personals Agency.
He should be 25 years old and clean -cut , with extensive computer and filing skills.
When the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man, Carla is both shocked and intrigued.
They leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery, where Carla interviews her prospective assistant.
When she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , Carla initially wants nothing to do with Paul, but has a change of heart and hires him on.
Although she is basically kind toward her helper, Carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power.
Paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker.
Carla helps Paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why Paul missed his appointment.
During one of their lunch breaks Carla informs Paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips.
Later, when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project Carla has been working on, a furious Carla asks Paul's help in seeking revenge on the man.
From here on in Sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years.
The screenplay borrows elements from Hitchcock, most notably REAR WINDOW, where Carla's lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars.
There is a teasing, on-again, off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars.
That being said, what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic Hitchcock thrillers, although those elements are definitely there, but the pervasive view a of a modern day city (in this case Paris) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy, garish nightlife where sex, drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters.
Unlike Hollywood productions, this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street, where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared.
It's Hitchcock with the gloves off."

She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists.
In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while Curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim.
It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Grey (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done.
Not only do the scammers make some cash, they get to spend the night at Grey's plush apartment.
Even then, Grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell.
Grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life.
Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, those savvy experts on life's realities? But, all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men.
Or is there? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected.
Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple but much edgier, of course.
Belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and Lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer.
John Hughes, as writer and director, shows us his magic touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable.
Just watch Curly and Bill take Grey out for a night, with no money, and see the humorous results.

2026_8	"I first saw this mini-series a number of years ago on British television and was immediately captivated by the story.
This rather surprised me as I am not a great fan of either 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I consider the heroine of the former to be a self-righteous bore, and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrap.<br /><br />'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall', like the aforementioned works, is also somewhat depressing in parts.
However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens.<br /><br />This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time.
At best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of the womenfolk in the Markham household.
At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate Helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect.
She runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but, as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering Helen Markham.
Not only incredibly beautiful (in spite of that terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film.
Tara is dignified and aloof while, at the same time, allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable.
Rupert Graves IS the depraved, yet curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing that part.
Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as does the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the Good Things in Life.
Finally, I could watch this film for Toby Stephens alone; he is so good-looking,rugged, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way).
I am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively!<br /><br />If there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which I felt both interfered with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing.
Other people, who have watched this film with me, also had problems with this, and I found I had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective.<br /><br />I am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film.
Not only did I puchase the video (a rare occurrence), but it led me to buy Anne Bronte's superb novel.
Naturally, this was better than the film, but only by a narrow margin.
I recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order.<br /><br />"
7854_10	This film has special effects which for it's time are very impressive.
Some if it is easily explainable with the scenes played backwards but the overlay of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made more than 94 years ago.
5329_9	"This film was great.<br /><br />The plot was preposterous.<br /><br />The action sequences contrived.<br /><br />But, provided you can lighten up enough to laugh, it was a throughly thrilling romp combining Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger.<br /><br />The baddies were more silly than bad.
The good guys weren't too good.
The black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes.<br /><br />The inclusion of a baby added a good touch.
Sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise.
<br /><br />I have to disagree about the acting.
It was, on the whole, very good.
I really wanted to punch Judge Reinhold.<br /><br />And, after all, isn't that the mark of a really good movie, wanting to punch Judge Reinhold?"
556_9	"Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their herd from Seattle to Alaska and on into Canada to stake a claim.
Once there, they have to contend with seductive, shifty businesswoman Ruth Roman and ice-cold, happy-go-lucky villain James McIntire.<br /><br />John Wayne may get talked about more, but his good pal Stewart made some excellent, hard-edged westerns too, some with the great director Anthony Mann.
Frankly, I'd take this, with it's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama, over North To Alaska any day!<br /><br />The Far Country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen.<br /><br />Also, there's some strong support by the always reliable Brennan, Roman (who's great), the incredibly cute Corrine Calvet, and James McIntire, 
who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously.<br /><br />This would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended Mann/Stewart northwest-set western, Bend Of The River."
10677_8	"This film was the first British teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society, rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life.
In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool's Junior Liaison Officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents, who have been dealt with under this scheme, have not committed a second crime.
However, this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem.<br /><br />Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of Juvenile Liaison Officer.
This hard-boiled character is a role typical of Baker.
Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer.
However, as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events, back to his original investigation.<br /><br />His first case leads him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by real-life brother and sister duo), who have committed a petty theft.
Here he meets Cathie (satisfyingly portrayed by Anne Heywood) their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with.
It quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency.<br /><br />The elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums.
McCallum does an eye-catching turn as the Americanized mixed-up kid, who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando, than any previous British star.
One is reminded of Brando's character Johnny from 'The Wild One' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'Johnny' leads his gang.<br /><br />Thankfully the preachiness of earlier Dearden crime dramas such as 'The Blue Lamp' is not so apparent.
Instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker takes the forefront.<br /><br />The plot, whilst at times predictable, does deliver some memorable scenes.
The disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music, leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant.
The most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children, including Mary and Patrick, are held hostage at gunpoint by Johnny.
Obviously in the light of the real-life Dumblaine Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying.
Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences."
8888_7	"This movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle.
However, the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak.
The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending.
Playing football in the yard? Really, could it get any more sappy and maudlin? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s.
I won't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it's anything like \The '60s.\"""""
12166_10	"A very strange and compelling movie.
It's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser/salesman.
The director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well.
Original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life.
There is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something I do as frequently as I should.
One of the more memorable films I've seen in a long while.

3403_9	"Gorgeous Techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who has left his monastery, breaking his vows.
The film opens at a convent in Europe, where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich).
She is advised by the Mother Superior to go to the desert and \find herself\"", and lose her grief over her father who has recently died.
In the train car on the way into the Sahara she sits opposite a very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk.
She's soon at a hotel near a palm-treed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl.
Domini becomes friends with him, though knows nothing of his past - romance soon to follow.<br /><br />This film is sentimental, melodramatic, and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a bit campy) - I found it to be quite fun and entertaining.
The photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme facial close-ups and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouetted figures against a sunset sky.
Marlene Dietrich gives a nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous.
Charles Boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good in this, I think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too.
Basil Rathbone is fine here, except given very little to do.
Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all, a very enjoyable film."""
2843_7	"If you're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation.
What I love is the ongoing surprises.
It's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in 'New York I Love You' to be continue.
Yeah, some of the short films makes you curious, some of them very short, some of them longer, some of them has it definite ends, some of them don't.<br /><br />Most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city.
It shows many different nationality background.
Many of it, make it feels the same way where I have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries.
This movie explore many type of things you might have known, but for all the characters it's a new things.
Maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; feel dreamy, sad, but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home.
You might want to reliving it again, by watching this."

Yes, this movie might have a few swear-words (there's that time where Knox swears, but they don't let you hear the full words), but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come (and that's including movies from back in the day).
Not only that, its very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family.<br /><br />The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it, I'm not going to mention them because I don't want any spoilers here.
<br /><br />All in all nicely done and a great movie to watch; so go out and get the kids, make some cookies, and watch this movie!"""

2282_10	"At first, I hadn't read the novel so far and I hadn't hear anything about the author yet.
But as I casually saw this movie, I was totally captive by the story.
Already as the Jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from Howard W.
Campbell Junior, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war.
Terrific! And the fictitious story about \the most effective spy for the USA in WWII\"", who have lost everything, that was important for his life, is wonderful emotional transcribed.
This is the best story about the duality of humanity, I've ever heard about! The questions, this movie is introducing, are in my opinion very important for our society: When does someone bear the guilt of something? What is guilt? Who is a hero and who is a felon? What is important in our life? Can you live without paying attention to the political changes? Is the protagonist guilty or not? These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years.
This is a must see for everyone, who have to think about the acception of war! This movie is a must see for everyone, who meditate, what matters in life and what doesn't..."""

11940_7	"As a baseball die-hard, this movie goes contrary to what I expect in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action, believable characters, and an original story line.
While \Angels in the Outfield\"" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds beautifully in the latter two.
\""Angels\"" weaves the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family, with that of the woebegone Angels franchise, struggling to draw fans and win games.
Pushed by his deadbeat father's promise that they would be a family only when the Angels win the pennant, Roger asks for some heavenly help, and gets it in the form of diamond-dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise's downward spiral.
And, when short-fused manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) begins believing in what Roger sees, the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around--and Roger and J.P.
find something to believe in.
Glover in particular gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, playing a washed-up pitcher, also does well, despite clearly having ZERO idea of how to pitch out of the windup!"""
9299_8	"Loopy, but shrewd and formidable mob boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) gets released from a mental hospital.
Several of Vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman \Brass Balls\"" Ben London (a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by Gabriel Byrne), the smarmy Jake Parker (a perfectly smug Kyle MacLachlan), and vicious rival \""Wacky\"" Jacky Jackson (a neat turn by Burt Reynolds) all try to bump Vic off.
Meanwhile, laid-back and self-assured hit-man Mickey Holliday (nicely played with low-key confidence by Jeff Goldblum) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy.
Writer/director Larry Bishop brings a supremely hip, quirky, and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal, loyalty, and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok.
The bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums: Ellen Barkin as tough, sultry moll Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic's reliable right-hand man Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's sweet, perky mistress Grace, Billy Drago as the slimy Wells, and Christopher Jones as brutish rub-out artist Nicholas Falco.
Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick.
Popping up in nifty bits are Billy Idol as a blustery thug, Michael J.
Pollard as the ill-fated Red, Joey Bishop as mortician Mr.
Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a jolly chauffeur, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger.
Byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka on \""My Way\"" rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight.
A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical.
Frank Byers' slick cinematography, the outrageously nutty dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score, and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio."""

5359_10	"Didn't Mystic Pizza win the Oscar for that year? This movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why I felt that way upon leaving the theater.
Only \Wargames\"" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling I was getting a glimpse of our future.
History has shown that this is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The casting is a pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to \""run\"" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of Family Feud with the contestants using real guns; Jesse Ventura as \""Captain Freedom\"" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as \""Subzero,\"" both \""stalkers\"" who kill the \""running men.
\"" Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) show up, while the \""dancers of the future\"" are none other than the Laker Girls.
This movie SCREAMS \""80s.\"" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as \""contestants.\"" Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge Salma Hayek in the 1990s.
<br /><br />The production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched.
I remember thinking when I was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today.
The government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down American public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for \""national security\"" is downright chilling.
Ben Richards is played brilliantly by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.<br /><br />The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with Back to the Future III, the \""ravine\"" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time.
It is tragic that, as with Wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved.
\""Serious\"" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more Oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their \""common man\"" counterparts, such as this one.<br /><br />An absolute must-see."""

And boy, was it ever! This French-Italian coproduction, while perhaps not the classic that Steele's first horror film, \""Black Sunday,\"" remains to this day, is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric, chilling entry in the spook genre.
Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma.
The film concerns a journalist who bets one Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood's castle on the night of All Saints Day, when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate.
The viewer gets to see these deaths, and they ARE pretty horrible, for the most part.
The film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched--thanks to the fine folks at Synapse--even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre.

10124_8	"Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm.
It's a yakuza/triad picture, involving cops versus Japanese &/or Chinese gangsters (mostly Chinese, as the title suggests), but already even in his first technical 'debut', Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in.
Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and one's roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbing-of-the-nose at taboos like gay sex and (satirical) rape/violence towards women; blood-curdling violence.
It's certainly not as surreal as some of Miike's most recent films, but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers.
It's got all of those qualities, and it's also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.<br /><br />The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya (Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwood-esquire anti-hero/hero), who's become a detective, and another, who's become a gangster, or a would-be one.
The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang (a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time, played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes), and his partner Karino (Takeshi Caesar, who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal), who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie.
There's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang's penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.
It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare (hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying \it won't come off\"").<br /><br />If it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it's par for the course of a film like this.
Miike's goals are met, though just met, in his low-scale ambitions: a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble (the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents), notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters.
At the same time, Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the Miike oeuvre.
Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the \""interrogation\"" as it goes into a very twisted area.
There's even a laugh-out-loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses: \""Thank you, Mr.
Weeny-Burger.\"" Miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.<br /><br />As the first entry of the \""Black Society\"" trilogy, as it's called, I was quite impressed, and it's a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema."""

Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades.
Like any really fine film, it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming.
I can't believe this film is SO difficult to find -- I'd buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet."
2628_10	"I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three Lion King movies! In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as Timon having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats!
 Timon and Pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also Simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping Simba face his evil Uncle Scar and proclaim his right as the Lion King of Pride Rock! Filled with wonderful new characters like Timon's Ma(Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller).
I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian Jerry Stiller the father of Ben Stiller.
Disney was smart to cast Stiller in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, and story and music Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride even though I will admit I really did like that one too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel the whole family can enjoy! It's got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!"
1423_10	"You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really great, it is a 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on.
I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet.
Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary-movie \An inconvenient truth\"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with \""truths\"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already.

599_10	"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting.
The writing was top-notch.
James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here.
Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker?<br /><br />Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times.<br /><br />While some may think the movie was slow-paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror.
<br /><br />What impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in.
In this day and age when nobody stands for anything, I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time."
6044_10	A great British Indy movie! Fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that Cheech and Chong would be proud of.
Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he has swapped sides since Quadrophenia!) and Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! Loved the final fight scene with it's nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire on Top of the Pops!...he's not acting....
he really is a bona-fide British hippie!!! You don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my Friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection.
<br /><br />Give this film a go and you won't be disappointed.
597_7	"The best film on the battle of San Antonio, Texas in March 1836, was John Wayne's 1960 epic THE ALAMO.
In a one shot job as director producer, that temporarily financially strapped him, Wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the West.
<br /><br />I have commented on that film in a review the other night, and I pointed out that Wayne and James Edward Grant (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle.
They did bring in the issue of slavery.
They also finally discussed the contribution of local Mexican land owner Juan Seguin as an important leader in the War for Independence on par with Crockett, Bowie, Travis, Austin, and Houston.
<br /><br />But there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film.
Wayne worked hard to cast it properly, thinking of many people for lead roles in it.
But, he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces, General Antonio De Santa Anna.
The role was played by an obscure actor, Ruben Padilla (on this board, his thread shows only three credits listed).
Padilla did not have any spoken dialog (even in Spanish).
And while he does have one of the last shots in the film, he just is shown as a silent tyrant, observing the burning of the bodies of the Americans and their allies.<br /><br />Despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie (THE ALAMO: THIRTEEN DAYS TO CLORY), it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to American policy makers.
Raul Julia was a wonderful stage actor.
I was fortunate to see him in a production (in the late 1980s) of ARMS AND THE MAN in Manhattan, as Sergius.
He was never boring, and usually first rate in his acting.<br /><br />Here we see the egotistical monster at his worst.
Nothing is acceptable that does not fit Santa Anna's wishes or activities.
It can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough, or it can be the temerity of these \foreign brigands\"" (as he saw the Americans) in not knuckling down to himself, \""the Napoleon of the West\"".
<br /><br />Santa Anna was President of Mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855.
He claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a President because that President did not live up to the country's constitution, but it was the power that kept him going year after year.
It is a sad commentary that he was the leading Mexican historical figure in those two decades.
No political figure or military figure would rise to override him until Benito Juarez did in the late 1850s.
Initially he claimed great liberal ideals, but he once admitted that the people of Mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves (and thus he sounds like Gilbert Roland in CRISIS talking about the people he has helped lead against Jose Ferrer).
The amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back.
His policies were disasters.
While we know about his attack on Texas (to put down a revolt there), he also tried to expand into Guatamala (and probably saw himself controlling much of Central America).
He did win at the Alamo, but at great cost of lives.
His massacre of Col.
Fannin's men at Goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the Alamo who were fighting to the last, but Fannin had surrendered).
Then came the disaster of San Jacinto, where his army was wiped out (he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the American troops).
He was captured, and humiliated, and forced to sign a surrender of Texas.
Houston was kind to him: the troops wanted to string him up.<br /><br />Except for losing a leg in a battle against the French in 1838, he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars.
He repudiated the forced surrender of Texas, but could not militarily undue it.
Instead, he would lead Mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the Americans, leading to the Mexican Session.
The U.S.
was \""decent\"" enough to pay Mexico $15,000,000 for the Southwest, but Mexico lost half of it's territory.
He would be President for the last time in 1853, in time to give Franklin Pierce's horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - Santa Anna sold the border of Arizona and New Mexico (the \""Gadsden Purchase\"") to the U.S.
No other Mexican President (not even Porfirio Diaz) ever cost his country so much (Diaz did sell out to foreign business interests, but he built up Mexico's economic muscles doing so).
He was exiled in 1855, and settled in Staten Island.
There he managed to do his most creative work: he introduced chicle to the U.S., and it became chewing gum.
Some achievement! <br /><br />Julia's Santa Anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became America's best land purchase agent.
He is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment's notice.
Most of the time his chief aide, Col.
Black (David Ogden Stiers, here a British born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be.
But Stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss.
At the end, when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead Alamo defenders, Stiers suggests that they tell the world what Santa Anna is really like.
And they did!"""
3969_8	"Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who is serving when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake.
I watched this movie on a video that I had taped off of the television.
When I watched this scene I thought I recognized the voice of Jones when the \waiter\"" laughed at the end.
I rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter.
Listen closely as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby, then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter, albeit, quickly."""
973_9	"Wow! So much fun! Probably a bit much for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very Terry Gilliam all the way through.
While the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward, Miike still throws in A LOT of surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments.
The whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero, with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein.
And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant.
As manic and imaginatively fun as other great Miike films, only instead of over the top torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via CG and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure.
F'n rad, and one of Miike's best!"
9211_9	"Action, horror, sci-fi, exploitation director Fred Olen Ray shows he has some talent as a director.
Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough/bad guys in the industry.
He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career.
As for Randy Travis he gives his best Lee Van Cleef impression.
He's not bad in the film.
Smith and Travis make the movie.
As for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out.
Ray did a great job directing this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I'd give this B western on a scale of one to ten(ten being the best) a seven."
9590_10	"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold \balls\"".
That's where they dress up however they like, strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on.
We get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other.
As one man says to another--\""You have three strikes against you--you're black, gay and a drag queen\"".
These are people who (sadly) are not accepted in society--only at the balls.
There they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted.
Then the film cuts to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some).
<br /><br />Sounds depressing but it's not.
Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations.
They're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor--just as they should.
We find out they all live in \""houses\"" run by various \""mothers\"" and all help each other out.
The sense of community in this film is fascinating.<br /><br />When this film came out in 1990 it was controversial--and a big hit.
It won Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals--but was never even nominated for an Academy Award.
Their reason was \""Black and hispanic drag queens are not Academy material\"".
Fascinating isn't it? Homophobia and racism all together.
<br /><br />Seen today it's still a great film--and a period piece.
It just isn't like that anymore--the NY they show no longer exists.
The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here.
Also drag has become more \""accepted\"" in society (for better or worse).
And I've heard the houses are gone too.
That's kind of sad.
I WOULD like to know where these characters are now--I know two died of AIDS but I have no idea about the others.
And what DID happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown? <br /><br />Still, it a one of a kind documentary--fascinating, funny and riveting.
A must see all the way! A definite 10.
Where's the DVD???"""
718_10	"Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so awesome was because of The Ramones! You couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash in place of The Ramones, it just wouldn't have been the same.
dey young, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel, and the hall monters, just added to the movie.
The whole entire movie is about The Ramones...especially Joey! So everybody showed see Rock 'n' Roll High School if your a huge fan of real PUNK.
Not the sissy new crap...but the loud, and fast kind.
The kind only The Ramones could do.
R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001.
Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!"
10524_10	"Jane Austen would definitely approve of this one!<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of Emma.
She is funny without being excessively silly, yet elegant.
She puts on a very convincing British accent (not being British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she fooled me...she was also excellent in \Sliding Doors\""...I sometimes forget she's American ~!).
<br /><br />Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) as the Bates women.
They nearly steal the show...and Ms.
Law doesn't even have any lines!<br /><br />Highly recommended."""
12097_7	"This complicated story begins fairly simply, with an English journalist accepting a wager from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted Blackwood castle.
Once there, the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors, until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room.
He sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood.
She informs him with an ambiguous charming/eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night...the Night of the Dead.
Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night.
SPOILER AHEAD: it probably won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost.
This doesn't prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple.
This is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, the spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence ( though both have been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) The alluring, captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it.
She has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies.
Recommended!"
7880_8	"The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing, dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing Eleanor Powell, abetted by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, featuring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra.
Red Skelton shares top billing with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are given most of the comedic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he, if it can be believed, performs as Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion.
The technical brilliance of Powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which Buddy Rich contributes his drumming skills, and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one's breathing to catch up with her precision.
Director Edward Buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal, and permits Powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair, as is appropriate."
9215_7	"What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film.<br /><br />Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in Alexandria, Egypt.
Genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who services daddy on the side.
Daddy gets sent back to the site, where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it.
Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade, and falls for a hunky Egyptian (providing the film's hottest scenes).
Eventually, Genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going.
Wrapped around this story is footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison, talking to a portrait of what looks like Genie.<br /><br />Robert Englund is terrific as both the Marquis and his descendant.
His acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here.
His best performance is still in \Killer Tongue,\"" if you have not seen that yet.<br /><br />The rest of the cast, including young Genie, are pretty and average.
The script, however, is problematic.
You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary, except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set.
The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever.
Who the mermaid is is never explained, and its link to Christianity (which is hyped throughout the film) is nothing.
The film is very anti-Christian, as the archaeologist is a Bible spouting father, but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute.
There are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say.
I know I have no idea.<br /><br />So why am I recommending this film? It is weird.
There is an extended sex scene.
For the ladies, hunky Egyptian rides a horse completely nude.
Englund is marvelous.
Do you like snakes? This film is full of them.
This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget.
Knowing Hooper somehow came up with \""Crocodile\"" after this is rather sad.
\""Night Terrors\"" is not perfect, but definitely worth a winking, unserious look.<br /><br />This is rated (R) for physical violence, some sexual violence, gore, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and drug abuse.<br /><br />"""
3552_10	"I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of Damon Runyon.
Without the wonderfully street, hilarious writings of Damon Runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960.
Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from Colorado, but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the East Coast.
If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend a few other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; \the Lemondrop Kid,\"" and \""Little Miss Marker,\"" both feature Bob Hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been a funny man.
(As a West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly funny, too!) Damon Runyon lives!!!!"""
7020_10	"*I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments: If you can take a serious movie, go see this.
Have an open mind and you will enjoy it.
Don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The movie fits together nicely in the second half.
I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens.
<br /><br />I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will was going around promoting the movie.
He was great--spent a lot of time with the fans.
Thank you for the picture Will! About Will's performance: A lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie/show, you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance.
This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie.
I didn't picture the Fresh Prince (lol) when I was watching this movie.
He was completely and utterly convincing in this very, very serious role.
He has grown immensely as an actor.
I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance.<br /><br />About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented.
He's sad...guilt-ridden...very determined, but very scared.
Very true to himself.
His character has a lot of depth...and somehow, Will managed to bring that to life.<br /><br />About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a nice job portraying Emily, a woman very much behind on her taxes.
Maybe she's not the shining star Will is in this movie, but she was very convincing.
I think her character just did not have as much to work with as Will's did.<br /><br />About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half of it.
I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so.
But when things eventually fit together, wow.
Surprisingly well written and well thought out.
It's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you.<br /><br />It actually takes a lot out of you to watch.
In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the end--even grown men.
When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment...<br /><br />******* Minor SPOILERS***** Which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away.
I feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it.
There was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed, though.
I will mention some of it here (without trying to give a lot away).<br /><br />-The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room.
At first, it makes no sense whatsoever.
There was a LOT of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish.<br /><br />-I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie.
By the end of it, I loved him and hated him.
That's how convincing Will was.
I thought Ben was being a huge jerk to Ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way in the world.
Why he was treating Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie.
Wait it out though.
Everything in this movie: wait it out.<br /><br />-Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for.
It's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people.
I think it's a little bit of both...I think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past.
I love his character.
You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing.
You hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally.
Nice job Will."
4614_7	"This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this piece of \Guilty Pleasure\"".
It is easy to condemn this movie for not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie.
But look at the year and do the math.
Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had long outgrown their parts! Time does that to young stars.
Yvonne De Carlo, who re-prised her role as Lili, was pushing the Big 6-0 (even though she still looked good and was still the perfect \""Lili\"").<br /><br />It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo wasn't given a larger part.
Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! During the 2 seasons that THE MUNSTERS was on prime time, it was the Gwynne/Lewis chemistry that made the series such a success.
The rest of the cast were supporting cast members, not to say that they weren't needed.
They were! The TV series wouldn't had survived as long as it did without them.
Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original \""Eddie\""), the choice was too easy.
Yvonne De Carlo was also the better choice over Joan Marshall.<br /><br />Though this movie doesn't measure up to the original TV series, it still measures up nicely and is one of the better \""reunuin\"" TV specials that plagued the boob-tube during the late 1970s/early 1980s.<br /><br />'"""
8348_10	"About 1986 I saw this movie by accident on TV one night.
I was 6 years old.
It was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to Don't Look Now in 1987.
I went to Venice on holiday the next year in silent terror, hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out I'd watched it! <br /><br />Would I have minded if my parents knew I'd watched Les Valseuses when I was a kid? I'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays, and my mum's probably disapproving in the afterlife.
I don't know if they'd want to see it anyway.
From the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes I'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself.
<br /><br />It's definitely violent.
It has a violent view of sex, virtually no acknowledgement of love.
Even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation.
But the scenario IS very erotic and (god I'm so British) arousing! Do they suck her breasts for her own good? That is exploitation.
So why am I getting a woody?<br /><br />The fellows go in search of an experienced older woman, find an ex-con, mother-figure? I don't know.
It ends in a truly gruesome suicide.
I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has Cannibal Holocaust-guts, and he went eeuurrgghh! No motherly love for this movie, quite the opposite.
Mutilation of where the boys began.
Why do they shoot the girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men?<br /><br />I'm thinking of two movies, one of which I wish I'd never seen, the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world.
Swept Away/Madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation! Once Upon A Time In America/Leone god why does Noodles do it? Destroys the path to joy we've been following him on his whole life.
So close to finally finding love with Deborah.
Now they are both destroyed.
Why Sergio? Why?<br /><br />There is no rape in Les Valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance, of both sexes.
Very honest, no titillation.
No fantasy shags, no perfect Hollywood smooth moves.
Jokes, yes.
But there's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy.
Forget Carry On Shooting A Naked Hairdresser In The Leg Cos She'll Come Back & You'll Hook Her Up With Your Ex-con Lover's Vengeant Son & She'll Learn How To Cum From Him.<br /><br />Two things I can't stand are rape movies and prison movies.
Les Valseuses isn't a rape movie! God nobody's going to want to watch it now! It is a brilliant movie!"
11675_10	"I always follow the Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' DVD home I couldn't wait to watch it! Of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams.<br /><br />If you watched Long Way Round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly I find more amusing than offensive.
<br /><br />I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he had it styled before Dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged; tho' I could have lived without the 'flame' undies lol As with LWR, the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself.
I nearly cried when Charlie broke his hand, and winced at every bruise he sustained while training....and of course the death of Andy Caldicott...that was an appalling tragedy, but then every year there's something.<br /><br />Russ drives me nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in LWR.
It's great to see him get along so well now with Charlie.<br /><br />What I learned from this odyssey was - 1.
never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for ANYTHING! - they had months to prepare the X5, and still the day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race; 2.
the Dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider/driver retrieval plan - leaving Matt (and presumably a large number of other riders/drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence; 3.
Charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for 'rough and tough' adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as he'd like; and finally, 4.
Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these epos called the Long Way Down in 2007, and I can't wait to get my hands on it! :D If you love bikes and/or genuinely nice blokes 'having a go', you have to watch this, I guarantee you love it.
It's very entertaining.<br /><br />In conclusion, to Simon Pavey - you sir are a hero, I was so impressed by the your 'quiet achiever' manner and the fact that you actually finished.....just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is.
And to Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - full marks for pulling it off.
To think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable.
You're all wonderful."

Him isn't very forthcoming because, not only has he been out of it for while, he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in (\""I haven't decided if I'm going to accept the part.\"").
The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville.
Stuck, Him decides to check out the local market.
He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet (Paz Vega) who operates the 10 items or less register.
Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent, Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role.
He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.<br /><br />But Him doesn't just use Scarlet, he helps her so he can see deeper into her life.
They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband, and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for, and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing.
This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him, too, showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain-store retail world (\""These shirts are only $12 bucks! How is this possible?!\"") The ending, as stated at the beginning of this review, is abrupt but apropos.
There's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond.
They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other.
It's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside Him's L.A.
mansion.<br /><br />This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going.
And it won't waste your time either."""
10762_10	"I was one of many that expected to see a glorified, Yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that (as famously quoted) should live in infamy, rather than glory.
How wrong I was.
These guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking.
And yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a NY firefighter, particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks.
At the beginning we see much of this footage, just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism.
This was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge.<br /><br />While investigating a suspect gas line (I think, my memory's a little hazy on that), we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead.
The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers.
What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? Recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on, and possibly realizing the same thing, the FDNY allow the camera to follow them into the building.<br /><br />What follows is a true view from the front-lines.
We see the commitment of the FDNY, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling) as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the outside.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering, the footage alone would be any young doco-maker's dream come true.
Quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time.
But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer.
We see firefighters charging in without hesitation, people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another (they are brothers) as they cannot reach one another in the confusion.
There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film, something Hollywood could never duplicate (even though it's trying).<br /><br />9/11 isn't a film about politics.
Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter.
9/11 is a film about people, and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of.
9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films I've ever seen, and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me.
You can't duplicate this."
7820_8	"\The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World.\"" <br /><br />Richard Attenborough, who directed \""A Bridge Too Far\"" and \""Gandhi\"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get his story told.
The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - \""Biko\"" and \""Asking for Trouble\"".<br /><br />The film takes place in the late 1970's, in South Africa.
South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race.
The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army.
We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants.
Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper.
After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him.
The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods.
This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world.
Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison.
Now Woods and his family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish his book about Steve Biko and the apartheid.<br /><br />When I first heard of \""Cry Freedom\"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko.
I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time.
But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and his journey across the border into Lesotho as he tried to elude the South African officials.
Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed.
So in order to publish his manuscript on Steve Biko, he had to escape.
Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's.
The real Donald Woods and his wife acted as consultants to this film.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie.
But he was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured his personality from what I've read really well and his accent sounded perfect.
His performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as his wife Wendy.<br /><br />Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa.
While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead.
Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid didn't end 'til seven years later, \""Cry Freedom\"" wasn't banned in South Africa.
But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats.<br /><br />Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination.
He doesn't hold back at the end of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them.
The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths.
Many had \""No Explanation\"".
Quite a few were \""Epilepsy\"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were \""Suicide from Hanging\"".
No one will ever know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; or to be more precise, at the hands of the police.
<br /><br />\""Cry Freedom\"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko.
It's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence."""
3465_9	"I sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope.
I didn't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter.
But it absolutely did, and then some.
First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon.
At times it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon.
The resemblance was often uncanny, and he clearly studied Lennon's mannerisms and vocal inflections.
Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, also bearing a striking resemblance to Macca, although he did occasionally trip over his Scouse accent.<br /><br />This work of fiction was well-written and well-directed.
It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion.
The rooftop scene was especially moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child--that he was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents.
I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band!<br /><br />My one complaint would be this: I am not so sure that John was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life.
He had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely, and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans.
Only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered.<br /><br />Mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had John lived a bit longer.
I am quite sure the Beatles would have come back together at some stage.
And I am quite certain that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today.<br /><br />Well done, VH1.
I will watch it again and again.<br /><br />"
6023_8	"I have to admit I have always found it difficult to watch an Antonioni film from start to finish at the first try, and even for this one, I ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions.
In the end, I realised perhaps it was better that way, because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one.
<br /><br />The first part seems a lot more fragmentary, which is not a bad thing, it just requires more of an effort to follow.
When it gets to the desert scenes, all efforts are repaid in full.
The stunning cinematography is only a part of it, what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence, the silence and vastness of it, the sense of sadness and freedom, the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters.
The desert is dead, but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part.
The dance between the airplane flying over and the girl's car makes for a series of great shots.
The love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful, it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times.
There is of course something very stylish and studied about them, but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural, spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days.
It all feels loose and unscripted (thanks also to the understated acting), but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form, which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end, a really mesmerising spectacle.
It just leaves you in awe.<br /><br />I don't really care for some the usual objections: boring - well, yes, it is, if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists, but then if all cinema was like that, that would be truly dull and sad; pretentious - maybe, but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills, depth, and style, pretentious is a compliment.
The \political\"" criticisms make the least sense to me, I don't see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse, patriotic requirements.
It just defeats the purpose.
Perhaps it's true that, like a previous commenter remarked, Antonioni viewed these young 'hippies' and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner, but I think that adds something rather than detracting from the film.
It's not true that hippies did not exist in Italy at the time (think of the '68 protests, like in France), although they were obviously different from the American counterpart and in some ways even more militant.
But his interest in this film was not narrowly political.
The events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal, timeless quality.<br /><br />A special mention for the fantastic soundtrack.
Amongst other things, this film, along with Easy Rider, is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary 'artsy' music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own, but unlike the former, it uses music in a much more subtle way, blending it with the landscape rather than the action.
<br /><br />If you want traditional narrative in a film, then don't bother.
If you want to be stunned, be patient and you won't regret it."""

My friends and I get together once a year to enjoy this movie.

7998_9	"I loved this movie.
I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it.
In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico.
It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse.
It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells.
We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character.
A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante.
Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities).
I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon.
That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!).
MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss.
It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it.
Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is).
The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half.
I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers.
His performance is nothing short of Excellent.
The ending (no spoilers, OK!!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway.
MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies.

3133_9	"Extremely well-conceived - part whatever happened to, part behind the scenes revisitation, part reunion film - all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun.
I only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on."
11134_9	"Acidic, unremitting, and beautiful, John Schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago, when American life was even more disorienting.
The film probably could not have been made at any other time in history, because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s: final dissolution of the Great American West, the intensification of war in Vietnam, and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety.<br /><br />'Midnight Cowboy' is widely known as the only Academy Award-winning film to garner an 'X' rating, but there is much more behind its fame; it also exceeds the norm as a work of art.
While this film (from the novel by James Leo Herlihy) has much to say about the erosion of American life, it transcends '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras.
The two main characters, in fact, are standard antiheroes - men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world.<br /><br />The initial focus of 'Midnight Cowboy' is on 28-year-old Joe Buck, a physically imposing Texas native played by Jon Voight.
In the opening scenes, we follow Joe's bus trip to New York City, where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents - the ability to pleasure women - and earn his fortune as a hustler.
We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade.
Garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as 'one hell of a stud,' the young Texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sickly con man and petty thief from the Bronx.
Ratso, who is short, thin, and with a limp, proves of little monetary help to Joe.
They quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months, Joe and Ratso shiver in a condemned Manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names.
It is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them, the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Joe hearkens back to earlier years in Texas, including life with his grandmother Sally (Ruth White), who served as guardian; his harried relationship with 'Crazy' Annie (Jennifer Salt), a notorious local girl; and a traumatic event in which Joe and Annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair.
Very much of its time, 'Midnight Cowboy' strings together a wild array of flashbacks, dream sequences, and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds.
For every moment of understanding we gain from Joe and Ratso, more questions about their lives are generated.
Both men are no doubt in tatters; they have no clear sense of direction until Ratso falls into the throes of illness and Joe finally senses a purpose for being alive.
This revelation pushes 'Midnight Cowboy' to its conclusion, a rather hopeful one in a very grim story.<br /><br />While Joe and Ratso badly need some luck, the direction of John Schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of Waldo Salt's screenplay in allowing Voight and Hoffman to thrive.
Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast, which features Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, and members of the Andy Warhol clique, offers itself as an essential part of the storyline.
The flashback sequences involving Voight, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost.<br /><br />Any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film, thanks to the excellent cinematography of Adam Holender ('The Boy Who Could Fly,' 'Smoke') and editing by Hugh Robertson ('Shaft').
The visuals of 'Midnight Cowboy' work with its soundtrack (assembled by John Barry) as a cohesive unit, sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades.
The lead song Everybody's Talking is sung by Nilsson, which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase.
The memorable harmonica theme is played by Jean 'Toots' Thielemans.<br /><br />'Midnight Cowboy' has been released in a two-disc collector's edition by MGM/UA, which contains expanded features and commentary.
Also available is a 1998 DVD release (used for this review), which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound enhancement; three-language subtitles and closed captioning; French 'dubbing'; a theatrical re-release trailer (not the 'original' as advertised); and an eight-page production booklet.
Both DVD editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film, showing its original brilliance.
Well-deserving of its three Oscars (best picture, Schlesinger, Waldo Salt) and additional nominations (Voight, Hoffman, Sylvia Miles, Hugh Robertson), 'Midnight Cowboy' will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics.<br /><br />*** ½ out of 4"
4965_9	"Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 best.
The other being fever pitch.
But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona.
This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful.
The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic.
This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein.
The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein.
highly recommended.
A classic of world football.

And I was very impressed by it.
It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /><br />What I remember of this movie is fragmented.
I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle.
This impressed me very much.
For some reason he was thrown out of his village (did not grasp the reason for this).
When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped off.
At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend.
As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace.

8834_9	"A very well made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia.
The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances.
A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives.
Highly recommended."
12137_10	"How amazing this film is! I've seen it over and over throughout the years and I'm always spellbound by it.
The reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is, of course, the arresting performance given by the young Bette Davis.
She not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by R.K.O.
Radio Pictures).
She wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho).
Her body was so curvy when she was young.
Get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard.
And oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene.
Howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero's sensitivity.
Frances Dee scores as the sweet, pretty young Sally who truly loves him.
Max Steiner's score is both charming and poignant.
Splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel."
5667_10	"Definitely spoilers in this review! I **adore** American Gothic and have done since I first saw it late at night when it first aired on Ch4 in the UK when I was 14.
The comparisons made to Stephen King are just about right.
It's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters.
Best of all, and the reason I love it so much, is it had the guts to never be black and white! Lucas Buck though lacking any conscience often works by, as he says, giving people enough rope to hang themselves with.
His manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals.
Caleb though generally a thoughtful, kind, insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father.
None of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic Merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in The Plague Sower.
Not only that but having Gail, the closest thing to a mother figure for Caleb, not only sleep with but fall in love with Lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it.
I'm a huge Buffy fan, but when that show tried to go really 'dark' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas.
AG shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show, and still have a hell of laugh doing it.<br /><br />I can't even think about why it was cancelled as I'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all.
So much rubbish on TV and good, original shows get kicked around and stamped on.
Thanks to the emergence of DVD at least I can see the show in it's entirety! Yes some of the visuals look dated now, but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines.
The actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work.<br /><br />The only reason why I think someone may not like this show is that it isn't like the X-files where there are cases to 'solve' or Lost where there's huge unanswered questions.
It's pretty obvious from the get go that Lucas Buck has some kind of evil powers, and that the show is all about fighting for Caleb's soul.
So this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown 'truth' to find.
Yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects, with some such as the truth about Gails parents getting resolved, but unlike Lost and X-files this show isn't about trying to find out more 'facts' about what's going on IMO.
It's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of Trinity.
Personally I would just get such a kick out of seeing Lucas turn every situation to his advantage.<br /><br />All in all the main thing I have to say is CHECK IT OUT.
I'm pretty certain most fantasy/horror fans will LOVE it.
Also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure.
The only hanging thread I felt was Dr Matt.
Having him not be in the final episodes is strange.
<br /><br />I would have done anything for a second season, but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some TV execs appear to be I should be glad this wonderful show got made at all!!!"
11783_10	"Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV series I have ever watched! It had some of the greatest rock n' roll songs ever written, performed by 15 very talented singers/performers.
It also had (in my opinion) the most heart-felt, feel-good, surprise endings in all of reality TV.
It actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner!!! Over the 13 weeks of this televised competition, the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants.
After 30-some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality TV show.
And the fact that INXS was, and still is, one of the greatest rock n' roll bands EVER just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series.
If you don't have the series recorded, ROCK STAR: INXS the DVD is a great alternative."

The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how I'd like to think love can heal someone's heart.
Laura Leighton...all of 27 when she made this movie...was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart.

6225_8	"This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals.
As usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play, Shore Leave, that also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical, Hit The Deck.
Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but what matters, as always, is the music, lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle.
It's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1) we get to see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs, one of which, I'm Building Up To An Awful Let-Down, had a lyric by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman, albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner Ginger before the story starts.
He gets to perform a little-known but excellent Berlin number, I'd Rather Lead A Band as well as duetting on I'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II were already being felt - Let's Face The Music And Dance, one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team.
So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, do they deliver.
Answer: In spades."
2031_8	"Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was, the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be.
It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality.<br /><br />The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River country after a three year absence.
The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century, of Australian history, legend and horses.
The storyline demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of Australian patriotism.
The plot is far more vibrant than the first film, and much more showy, with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film, yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, a stunning focus of the Australian high country, the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland which equals the first in every way.
Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film, and it is highly worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry.
The lead cast, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy, carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film.
As far as sequels can go, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again."
894_9	"This, \Prodigal Son\"" and \""Eastern Condors\"" are my favourite Sammo Hung films.
The Fat Dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in \""Condors\"", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor.
He is, in fact, at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story also.
Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes.<br /><br />The opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone.
A sequence in which Sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone.
The fast and furious stick fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its type.
The film's violence escalates slowly until, finally, when the climactic showdown comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a Sammo production.
The director/actor's assault on Billy Chow and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.<br /><br />Terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made.<br /><br />Great score, too."""
2478_10	"The image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it's more true than false).
This begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed Kenneth Branagh to create a full-length, uncut version of \Hamlet\"" with his complete creative control among other things.
Of course, Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see? Could they have, at least in this case, had enough respect for the material and Branagh's vision to create something for only a few people? That is not a question that I can answer.
Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching \""Hamlet.\"" Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that.
However, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before.
According to some, Shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion.
That being said, I have no doubt that had he been able to see it, the Bard would have been overjoyed with Branagh's production.<br /><br />The film is top-heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts.
All play their parts equally well.
I would have thought Branagh too old to play the part of Hamlet, and while he still may be, his performance more than makes up for it.
Hamlet is a complex part, displaying every emotion from grief to anger, happiness to madness, and everything in between.
Branagh nailed it.
Derek Jacobi is terrific as the wily Claudius, whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion; his unique voice is perfect for the role.
Julie Christie is also very good as Gertrude, Hamlet's caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game.<br /><br />The classical actors are cast in bit parts (Judi Dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they're in it.
Surprisingly, no one takes this to heart; everyone gives it their all, and it shows.
Special mention has to go to Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are excellent.
Robin Williams is a little too silly, but he's not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).<br /><br />Yet, this is undeniably Branagh's show.
He adapted one of the most famous plays in history, and in so doing, he took on a whale of a project; it's impressive that he got it done, but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement.
What I really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy it.
As most people know, Shakespeare is difficult to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand this.
\""Hamlet\"" is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone and everyone.
It may be four hours long, but it's definitely worth it."""

Asides from it's little plot, the weak drama and bits of comedy antics, the movie is action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action.

This modern action film is highly recommended!!"
6457_7	"Kay Pollak's 2004 heart-warmer Så som i himmelen/ As it is in Heaven contains every stereotype of Swedish humanity and inhumanity yet manages to be a crowd-pleaser.
It contains plenty of ammunition for cynical critics, continuity error-spotters and for saccharine-debunkers, yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community evocatively.
The film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about 'finding one's own voice' and 'just doing it despite one's fear', without completely removing the lump from the throats of the cynics.<br /><br />Its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts.
Firstly, small films about strangers bringing new life to rural Christian communities provide plenty of scope for the exposure of hypocrisy while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their hairshirts.
The same year and with a similarly Swedish breeze, The Queen of Sheba's Pearls did it, and Babette's Feast also comes to mind.
Secondly, any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individual/self- focused and impersonalized world.
This film's structural similarity with the likes of The Full Monty, Brassed Off, Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness to the formula.
But it is a formula with life left in it yet, and this seems to be because people need positive- message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves.<br /><br />The stranger is burned-out maestro Daniel Daréus on a quest for self-rediscovery.
The town he visits, or rather revisits, is, unbeknownst to the townsfolk, the place of his childhood.
He was bullied mercilessly by classmates here, supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without aspiration to drive a truck.
Here, he takes the job of cantor/choirmaster, despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders.
The place is, of course, populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character arcs can be predicted: the broken-hearted, fair-haired girl so beautiful she nearly glows; the cellphone-ringing local businessman; the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse; the steely pastor and his less austere wife, who at first seem right out of Ingmar Bergman.
Also present: jealous, uptight spinster (Siv) (check); geriatric whose soul still sings (check); elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten (check); obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say 'fatty' (check); intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good 'A' (check).<br /><br />Pollak's film is not all warm fuzzies, however.
It diverts from the 'let's put on a show despite setbacks and moral opposition' sub-genre.
It contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative nirvana.
The violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and repression, but in never delves deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife beater is like this.
Similarly, the small town Pastor so closely adheres to the moralistic, black-wearing super-Protestant stereotype, that his secret indulgence in girlie magazines is hardly surprising.
His repressions and hypocrisies are just there, dangling unrelated to psychological reality.
Perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy, a lost son perhaps, glimpsed once over his shoulder, holds the secret.<br /><br />Perhaps these holes are functions of the editing, like several inconsistencies and continuity glitches that can be spotted, such as Siv's unexplained reappearance in the choir (twice) after moralistic outbursts.
In fact none of the hitches in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene.
Apart from in some awkward love scenes, the film's 127 minutes seldom drag, but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />The film remains solid three-star-fare despite the holes that can be picked in it.
This is simply because in a world of technology-focused flicks and materialistic self-seeking, any glimpse of human community is, deep down, welcome for anyone, even the cynical."
2518_10	"This is, by all categories, the best movie I have ever seen.
Forget Hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art! Moon Child's story starts with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who loathes what he has become and lives in denial.
His wish for final death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live.
Here, he meets Sho, an orphan living on the street.<br /><br />From here, the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie.
It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy...
Never has a movie touched me the way this movie do.
And the actors are amazing - never have I heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange.
A big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece...<br /><br />A last comment on this brilliant movie, is that it stars Gackt (ex-vocalist of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (vocalist of L'Arc~en~ciel) in excellent roles as Sho and Kei.
I am amazed at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out.<br /><br />This is a must see.
If you never see any films, see Moon Child, the Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children.

I had never seen a film like this before.
It had a strange, hypnotic effect, quite unlike the films that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact.<br /><br />I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins.
Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer.<br /><br />If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased."

Kitschy and campy (though surprisingly faithful to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible.
Seeing this movie about British royals spoken in German adds to its quaint charm.
On that front, one wonders why an Austrian movie was made about an English queen; but then one remembers that in 1954, Austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including British ones.
Maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film."

I've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O'Neill, the not-only-smart Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, women and kids favorite, and brilliant Dr.

7551_10	"Best animated movie ever made.
This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely boggling effects, but the branches of the human mind, soul, and philosophy.
The story features a family of cats, where in the big sister dies, the younger brother sees this and rescues her body, but when she awakens she is left without a soul.
So, the two sibling cats embark on a journey to find it.
I have related this journey to many things.
The history of the world, the bible, the cycle of life, and every time I watch it I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors.
If you aren't so into the physiological aspect of it then, you will still adore it.
The animation is superb, and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen.
For example, the ocean freezing in time, god eating soup out of the earth, a strange and slightly SNM retelling of Hansel and Gretel.
To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for anyone.<br /><br />PS- Not for kids, gratuitous violence included."

As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today.<br /><br />The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together.
The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.<br /><br />In a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York.
It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created.
In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality.
The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals.

12187_9	"Neatly sandwiched between THE STRANGER, a small film noir picture that proved Welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties, and MACBETH, a no-budget Shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days, comes THE LADY FROM SHANGAI, a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of Wellesian mythos that covers THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, MR.
ARKADIN and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses.<br /><br />Six years after THE MALTESE FALCON, with the post-war craze of the film noir in full swing, Welles, always ahead of his time, a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity, envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker, more sinister, paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time.
It's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time, to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor, and it was once again Europe that championed it as another Welles classic.<br /><br />Certain set-pieces stand out.
The aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows, and of course the Funhouse/Hall of Mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of Wellesian bravura as any in CITIZEN KANE or THE TRIAL.
The only faults I find with the movie is Welles' ill-advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act.
The story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner, which the cuts only serve to intensify.
I believe the heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter.<br /><br />Welles would exile himself in Europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic, the monumental TOUCH OF EVIL, perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time.
Shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for Hollywood's premiere star of the time, Rita Hayworth, ought to have been, and Welles marriage with Hayworth ended before the movie was even released.
Sixty years later and one hour of footage less, Shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover.
Surely that must count for something."

I had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented.<br /><br />Watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so I was skeptical I would even care.

10172_8	"Friz Freleng's 'Rumours' is an excellent Private Snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime.
Produced, as were all the Snafu shorts, to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films, 'Rumours' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan.
When Snafu starts a rumour about a bombing, it escalates into an eventual rumour that America has lost the war.
This is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long, rubbery piece of baloney and several strange, fictional creatures who come back to haunt Snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military.
'Rumours' is inventive, fast paced and funny, all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured, \don't badmouth the military\"" message.

His trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net.
The soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball.
\""Bend it like Beckham\"" means making that type of spectacular shot.
Apart from that, and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux-cameo at the very end, the movie has nothing to do with him.
<br /><br />The movie is full of little soccer in-jokes, such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it (property of the great Mia Hamm, to those in the know), references to \""Posh 'n' Becks,\"" the video homage to the WUSA one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend (\""They *have* that??\""), lesbian gags, sports-bra gags, and so on.
<br /><br />The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a soccer star.
She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA), and her parents, who are Indian immigrants set in very old-fashioned ways that do not allow daughters, among other things, to engage in contact sports.
The girl's family are portrayed as figures of ironic fun, but with great affection -- think My Big Fat Greek Wedding.

12427_7	"This film has a lot of raw potential.
The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good, though some of the experimentation just doesn't work.
The main problem here is David Duchovny.
Once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he's incapable of playing anything but Fox Mulder.
He postures, he tries to be slick, he poses, he tries to be macho.
In the end he just tries too hard.
He overplays his character, he overspeaks his lines, and he's just outplayed in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill.
Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good.
There was a spotty moment or two where he over-dramatized his role, but you could tell he was having fun with it.
He looked the part, and he became the character both physically and atmospherically.
Angelina Jolie was also really good.
She didn't have much of a role; in fact, I though she could have used a much stronger one...her character wasn't nearly developed enough, though she did remarkably well with what she had.
And the chemistry between her and Hutton was apparent (gee, maybe that's why Uma left him...;) All in all, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles.
If David Duchovny hadn't ripped his role to pieces it would've been *that* much better.

It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and/or Charlton Heston films.<br /><br />Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A.
had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective.
I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period.
Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print.
From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.<br /><br />Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.
<br /><br />Their chemistry together is wonderful.
The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print.
Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen,and the cinematoraphy, writing, music used, and everything about it works.
The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future.
Just think how the world population grew, the rain forest that disappeared, resources used up, green house effect getting worse since 1973.
I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years.
Its reputation should be better.<br /><br />Speaking of reputations, often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor.
Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors.
Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.<br /><br />"

I can buy that critique, but she's still fabulous, partially because she's unlike anything I've ever seen before.<br /><br />This film is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect.

It makes you question where does racism begin and end...and with whom.
It shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have, you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you.
It also shows how these African American children, when \""blending in\"" neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture (complete with blonde hair and blue eyes, mind you!) around them.
They laugh along with the jokes, not knowing they ARE the joke and not knowing..why.<br /><br />But overall, this film is about 'people'.
No matter what race you are, this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other...all for the sake of fitting in..all because you feel you have more money than others, so that automatically makes you better -- and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you.

Soles is so exuberant, you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school (that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24).
The movie is a fast-paced frolic that doesn't cop-out; everything gets blown to smithereens at the end, and that's just as it should be.
Mary Woronov, an innately kinky and funny presence as the Nazi-like principal, gets a great, one-of-a-kind bit at the beginning where Frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did they use on that, or was it a fluke?) and Dey Young is very appealing as Soles' best, Kate Rambeau.
The weakest link, ironically enough, in this \""High School\"" chain-gang is the Ramones.
They can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment goes on too long.
One Ramones song, \""I Want You Around\"", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare Paul McCartney ballad heard near the beginning (\""Did We Meet Somewhere Before?\"").
Great fun! *** from ****"""
3118_9	"Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies, I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum.<br /><br />However it was a very thrilling experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films.
Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it had reached the interval! I don't think I have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film.
Since I usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me.
Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.<br /><br />Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne.
I've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list.
I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.<br /><br />The stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie.
Well done."
7287_7	"THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962.
Today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.<br /><br />The story, of course, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab.
With the aid of a few telephone cords, a couple of clamps, and what looks very like a shallow baking pan, he brings her head back to life.
But is she grateful? Not hardly.
In fact, she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing, particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.
<br /><br />As it happens, the doctor is picky about this new body: he wants one built for speed, and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks, haunting strip joints, visiting body beautiful contests, and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow.
But back at the lab, the head has developed a chemically-induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments, this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet.
Can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance, wreck revenge upon the doctor, and save the woman whose body he hankers for? Could be! Leading man Jason Evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of Spanish fly; Virginia Leith, the unhappy head, screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords.
Busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music, actors make irrational character changes from line to line, the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot, and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs.
On the whole THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an Ed Wood movie.<br /><br />Director Joseph Green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip, and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors, who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it.
The cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost, but the cuts made for television have been restored in the Alpha release, and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.
<br /><br />Now, this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious, depending on your point of view, so it is very hard to give a recommendation.
But I'll say this: if your tastes run to the likes of Ed Wood or Russ Meyers, you need to snap this one up and now! Four stars for its cheesy-bizarreness alone! GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
11994_10	"As for many on here I can't help but praise the Cast and Crew who developed Talespin and others they made throughout My Childhood, I as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the Quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters.
<br /><br />To Class this work of art as a \Cartoon\"" could never do talespin justice, In fact it's an insult to class it as a \""Cartoon\"", Talespin is an Animation and nothing less, It is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at Disney to date, When Disney \""Pulled\"" it from the air little did they realise what they did and I'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since.
<br /><br />I'll take a moment to explain, From the first which is ducktales to the last which I think is Darkwing Duck, Disney has been plagued with failures due to political Correctness and have taken a Quantum Leap backwards since, They prefer Quantity over Quality now not to mention the room full of Monkey's for the story's,
 I couldn't have My children watching the mind-numbing \""Cartoons\"" they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer Simpson some time in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it,
 I couldn't let that happen, Which is why I have ALL of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a Harddrive so one day My children couldn't be corrupted by the \""Cartoon Crap\"" of today and to Savour the last piece of childhood I have and to hold on to and I owe that all to Talespin.
<br /><br />Talespin to me is without a doubt the best Animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth, Charm, Wit, Compassion, Emotion and lack of Truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today,
 Do You see any of that content in say \""Ed, Edd and Eddie or anything else You can think of?, The rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old's undecipherable Hyroglyph Depicting a Picasso.
<br /><br />The next time You watch an episode of Talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as Higher for Hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this Animation, Even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again, The Buildings look true to the Art Deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted, Even the vehicles are true to life,
 OK not ALL of the Episodes Were Fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and You'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail.
<br /><br />The one thing I love about this is what I like to call the \""Deliberate Mistakes\"" or \""Intended Mistakes\"" in each episode and some have two,
 For example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say's \""You're up to something Baloo\"" and Baloo replies \""Who, Me!, I'm as innocent as a schoolboy\"" take a look into rebecca's eyes, I won't spoil the rest of the Baloopers but just keep an Eye out next time.
<br /><br />Everyone elses comment's are bang on and 100% correct, I have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here,
 Disney, WAKE UP and smell the coffee, You have been asleep for over a decade, Stop producing rubbish and bring back Quality into Animations and Stop producing \""Cartoons\"", We have seen the proof of what You can do and We want it back as rapidly as possible."""

1303_10	"Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called \Cream.\"" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music.
They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.<br /><br />Well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us.
I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I hadn't seen in decades.
They surprised me.
When he was young, Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death.
Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid.
Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs.
This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.<br /><br />Some people criticized this show for being low-key.
I don't agree with that.
I have no complaints.
The concert sounded very good.
The second song, \""Spoonful,\"" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.<br /><br />Highly recommended."""
3660_10	"This obscure de Sica delivers the goods.
And it is said \the meek shall inherit the earth.\"" This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war.
They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers.
de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story.
I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio.
It begins with the words, \""Once upon a time...\"" to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere.
Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all.
De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best.
Abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world.
Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
6838_7	"*** out of ****<br /><br />Yep! Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie.
It's like Kalifornia, but it's different.
Remember? That movie from 1993 which stars Brad Pitt as a serial killer who is \welcomed\"" by a couple of travelers in a trip to California as a buddy who might be a good company along the way.
When I watch a movie, I always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler.
That's how it was with Kalifornia.
When I watched it last year for the first time, I never realized it was a suspense movie, so when I found out, I was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and I was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close I was to it! So, we're discussing about Dressed To Kill, right? Before I watched this movie (today!),
 I've only watched 2 others movies from Brian De Palma, so I can say I don't really know that well his works, but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be.
Carrie (1976) and Mission:Impossible (1996).
When I watched Carrie on the TV, I was really that desperate to get a DVD copy and I can tell: this movie is great! Mission:Impossible also.
And today, I watched a third movie from DePalma.
<br /><br />Well, Dressed To Kill is a movie like Kalifornia.
When the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect.
I was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where Dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room.
You may guess what may have happened there.
But when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path.
I was watching the rest of the movie, and I really liked it.
However, there are some low points...
Some characters in the movie are completely silent! Take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene.
I was always hoping that he could say something but he never did! This was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece.
Even in the cab scene, where Dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other.
You know, it reminded me of the Mexican TV series of the 70's \""El Chavo Del 8\"", where some characters are completely silent.
Getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot.
Dennis Franz is cool as detective Marino! Reminded me of him as Capt.
Carmine Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 (1990) where he plays almost the same kind of character.
<br /><br />Well, concluding this review, the ending of Dressed To Kill is the same ending as it is in Carrie! I don't know if I really liked that, because I hate imitations! I understand that Carrie is a movie from DePalma, so it's not actually an imitation, because after all it was his idea! But it turned to be a repetitive idea in Dressed To Kill,
 so DePalma could have done something different instead of showing Nancy Allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to Amy Irving at the ending scene of Carrie.
This was, of course, with no doubt, another low point.
But if you get past this, you will find that Dressed To Kill is a really good movie, and I assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it."""
2321_9	"Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching.
And mostly, it's for two reasons.
One, it concentrates of young people, VERY young people.
People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are.
All of us have been there in our lives and \The Man in the Moon\"" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced.
The second reason is that is a love triangle.
And I do believe that as teens, it's the most dramatic.
And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The cast of \""The Man in the Moon\"" is full of great talented names.
It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film.
Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon.
You look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she's going to win the Academy Award.
All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations.
As if it all really happened.
This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often.
Love story or not.
I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way."""
4711_8	"Oh, what fun there is here! <br /><br />Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking) but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun.
Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny, easily his best screen performance.
Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, what a shame directors didn't pick up on this.
And I have even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary.
I don't think it's an accident that the bulk of the character's name is spelled MORON.<br /><br />Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner given good lines.
Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in a good lines.<br /><br />recommend it to a friend."
5828_9	"Micro-phonies is a classic Stooge short.
The guys are inept repairmen working at a radio station, and during some horsing around in a broadcast booth, Curly's perfect mimic of a recording of \Voices of Spring\"" is mistaken for the real thing, leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party.
The trio's mock rendition of the quintet from \""Lucia de L'Amamore\"" is especially entertaining.
No doubt this is essential viewing for Stooge fans.<br /><br />Although the evidence of Curly's failing health is visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing, and it is probably the last glimpse of the old Curly.
Some fans think that \""A Bird in the Hand\"" is the last great Curly short, but his coarse voice and slow movement are just too difficult to watch."""
11607_10	"Picture Bride has an excellent look into Hawaii's past and the people who lived there in that time.
The time, money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live, takes a whole new meaning to blood, sweat and tears.<br /><br />The concept of dating/matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net.
Just that is more of snail mail.
Very slow snail mail.<br /><br />The singing of the plantation's songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers' songs of their demise and future goals.<br /><br />The movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring.
Like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility."

The actors are visually compelling especially Karisma Kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world.

10584_10	"\Footlight Parade\"" is fascinating on so many levels.
There is no way the supposedly staged \""theater prologues\"" could have been produced in any theater on earth, of course.
Think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for \""By A Waterfall,\"" for instance.
(Berkeley directed John Garfield in \""They Made Me a Criminal\"" six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing \""By a Waterfall\"" as they took their showers.) <br /><br />\""Shanghai Lil\"" is the best production number in the picture.
It's a catalog of '30s Warner Bros.
sensibilities.
Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes.
You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house.
Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others.
I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a \""card section\"" presentation of Roosevelt's image.
There's also the NRA eagle--the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal.
FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the Depression.
You'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM, of course.
Warner Bros.
wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F.D.R.
administration.
<br /><br />Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker, \""Lil.\"" She hardly even watches her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature flaws.
<br /><br />The Pre-Code stuff is fun.
The \""By a Waterfall\"" number is wonderful in that regard.
The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on.
The spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years.
In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures."""

An excellent film for those into period dramas, the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film."""
6758_10	"Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950)<br /><br />Where One Ends, Another Begins<br /><br />This is a prototypical film noir, and as such, pretty flawless, from both style and content points of view.
The photography and night settings are first rate (cinematographer Joseph LaShelle lets the drama ooze in scene after scene), and the close-ups on faces pure expressionism.
I can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone, even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks.
<br /><br />But the acting is first rate here, and the plot features what I consider the core of most noir films, the alienated male lead (representing the many men returning home to a changed United States after the war and feeling lost themselves).
In fact, not only is Dana Andrews really convincing as the troubled, loner detective, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the lead female's (first) husband, an decorated ex-GI fallen onto hard times and booze.
The fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance, overall-- the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medal-wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head.
The woman transitions from one to the other--we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie.
Even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact, we can still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage careening through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order--turning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with it.<br /><br />This movie belongs to Andrews.
He plays a far more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story made just one year later, and Andrews certainly is less theatrical.
You could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session.
The fact that Andrews as Detective Dixon is morally struggling through it all, and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not, might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesn't.
Gene Tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic, demurring, and ultimately conventional and \pretty\"" type of woman--not just a cardboard desirable, but someone you want Dixon to actually marry.
<br /><br />The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is effective enough in its play with types and clichés.
The bit parts are kept snappy, the small details (like the portable craps table) nice touches, far from the character actors or the glamour of gambling in Casablanca.
But then, Curtiz's great movie is iconic even in the details--it makes no effort to be subtle and real and penetrating, but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring.
They come at opposite ends of the war, and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men.
Bogart is beginning his active duty, Dixon, and the man Dixon has killed, are all through.
Through, thoroughly, but not washed up.<br /><br />It's no accident that many, possibly most, film noirs have what you would call \""happy\"" endings.
The man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self, and the moviegoer, then and now, understands just how beautiful that must feel."""
10753_10	"To those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed, I disagree.
This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day.<br /><br />IMDB asks us to rate this movie.
I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made.
The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable.
We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened.
They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety.
To judge whether it's nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing, amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer.
I just know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other.<br /><br />I submit a wholehearted 10.
This is why the art of filming was created! To capture the natural emotion that real life offers.
You can keep your kung-fu junk.
Romance is cute.
Action will never reach this level.
This movie, 9/11, will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself.
It didn't have a sneak-peek.
It didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare.
It had class, composure, substance, and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world.
It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera.
Please consider this movie, as it itself proclaims, a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of America.<br /><br />How can you give anything less to a movie that shows, not embellishes, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times.

2691_8	"Probably Bigas Luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism.

He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too.
His pursuit of May IS the film.
As in Luna works such as \""Lulu\"" and \""Jamon! Jamon!\"", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale.

6847_10	"i just finished watching Dressed to Kill,which is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD had both the\R\"" rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the \""R\"" rated version,i can't be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.
i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the \""R\"" rated version.
but i digress.Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.
it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.
most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.
the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films.
anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,
in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and it's really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.
but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it.
i also really liked the musical score,composed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,Dressed to Kill(1980)is 10/10"""
3889_10	"Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius, and this is Eddie at his very best.
His material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage.
Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing, and the British.
With so many memorable laughs, one can't help but repeat some of his lines.
Forever more, \Do you have a flag?\"" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine.
Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see \""Dress to Kill\"".
By far the best British standup comedian I've ever witnessed, Eddie Izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage.
However, his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is.
\""Dress to Kill\"" is a treasure, one that luckily has found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again."""
5480_10	"This is a great movie, it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government.
This isn't as bad as what Reagan and Bush number one did to South America, but the US still has no business messing around with other countries like this.
This movies also proves that American media spouts government propaganda.
This is exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti.
The reason this coup against Chavez didn't succeed is Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote.<br /><br />This movie isn't just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie if it were a drama, it's amazing that this is real.<br /><br />The other reviewer is lying when he says \Chavez seizes the airwaves\"", the private media is running anti Chavez propaganda all the time."""
2576_8	"I am of \the Christopher Reeve Generation\"" it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman yet, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock Chris off the top, though he just barely falls short.
That doesn't stop me from enjoying this film, it has a lot going for it.
It has all that a movie needs, a plot with beginning, middle, and end, plus all those parts are intelligently written.
The film is edgy both in acting and storyline, something a film-noir but with tights.
The story is both exciting and meaningful, this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy.
I am still amazed this was shot over 12 days, oh the glory days of Hollywood, when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell...
The film is polished and expertly made, directed by Lee \""Roll'em\"" Sholem, best known for directing with both speed and efficiency.
It never lets the constraints of technology slow it down, in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight, including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from Superman's point of view, also a few closeups of George in process work, and a long shot of an animated Superman.
<br /><br />This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series.
A DVD worth owning in its own right, the inclusion of the film as its original whole, is icing on the cake.<br /><br />Give Blood Today God Bless!"""
4926_8	"Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country ever had, showed he was equally at home with movies.
With \Panic in the Streets\"", Mr.
Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his master piece, \""On the Waterfront\"", although both movies share only the water setting, for they are different visions about different subjects.<br /><br />Mr.
Kazan shot on location in New Orleans.
The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories that are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting \""The Big Easy\"".
One of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best.
Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch.<br /><br />This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like \""broklynese\"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country.<br /><br />One thing comes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smolders the screen every time one sees him.
He was so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is stricken with a fatal disease.
Blackie, comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon.
Notable also, was the fact that Mr.
Palance and Mr.
Mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real.<br /><br />The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film.
We see a family man painting furniture with his young son.
Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis.
Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people.
Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from Connecticut.<br /><br />The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr.
Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie."""
2396_7	"This is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of Macbeth.
Although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously.
Recognizable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the \murder\"" of Banquo (John Elsen) is rehearsed.
Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film."""

It's a crime comedy that's often very funny.You can't help but laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys.
There are some great actors playing these characters.William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pero's love interest Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the tattooed guy in a wheelchair.This is a highly entertaining flick.I certainly recommend it."
624_9	"The summer has been so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that I was woe to find a film I could just sit down and enjoy.
<br /><br />In case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds.
Think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close.
<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others...
Maybe once or twice a month, if I feel active.
I'm also a huge Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan.
I get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.<br /><br />By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust.
Having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, the previews of Stardust seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary.<br /><br />As many others here, I was utterly surprised.
I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast.
Don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief...
But the most refreshing thing I found, is that it's NOT based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie.<br /><br />((Unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another \Epic fantasy tale, the likes of LotR and the rest\"" so says the NYT and such and such no doubt.
))<br /><br />Stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom.
It didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you).
It's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough I could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy I hate those).
<br /><br />I just...
watched.
Watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly CREATIVE storyline unfold before my eyes.
Sure, I may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that.
It even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater feeling better than when I'd gone in.<br /><br />It truly is a gem.
After so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work I'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth.<br /><br />It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie.
This little diamond is finding its way into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this.<br /><br />Simply wonderful."""
1538_10	"This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /><br />Maybe it's because I live just a few miles from the village were the story take place, and I know how things work out in this area in Sweden.
The movie tells the truth, believe me! It both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of Dalarna, and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives.<br /><br />But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably also recognize much from this movie.<br /><br />Thank you Maria Blom!"

7003_10	"The emotional impact of this movie defies words.
It is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours.
This is Will Smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full range of it.
Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith.
His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I view him differently now.
Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief.
Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically.
It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice."
8312_10	"The Life and Time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard, as produced and directed by Little Richard, was about as one sided as one of his songs.
This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but does have good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing Richard.
All the music is by Little Richard, so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song.<br /><br />The movie covers his early childhood, carrys thru the formative years in music, the wild success and Richard's throwing it all away to praise the Lord.
Its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, whom opened for him.<br /><br />My main objection is that his outrageous, counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time.
Some of his energy, which he still has, does not come across full force.
He seemed tame, compared to what I remember of him at the time.<br /><br />The best scenes are Richard getting jilted by Lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing, to make the point about not having a decent place to change.<br /><br />If they had gotten into the \Bronze Liberace\"" as Richard use to refer to himself in interviews, then there's a story.
Trust me I just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys, giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience, his headband.
Nearly 68 and still going strong I recommend this movie and any concert or T.V.
appearance you can find.

A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there.
Yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace.

11734_10	"This has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak 'Elvira's Haunted Hills'...anyway I love the way the movie is a goth/com 'Wizard of Oz' story...<br /><br />Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a Good Witch (elviras Aunt Morgana)...she inherits a \Ruby\"" ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock (Her uncle)...
She befriends four Characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow.
There is a show down with her uncle (the wicked witch of the West) where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him.
In the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas).<br /><br />There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie...she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters.
Elvira: \""Youe must be aunt Em, and you must be uncle Remus....There's no place like home, there's no place like home!\"" Bad uncle Vinny: \""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!\""<br /><br />There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas.<br /><br />But aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she \""ripped off, um...

360_10	"11 Oscar nominations and zero win!!! Am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the Oscars that year......
it should go into the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges....
<br /><br />Its an amazing book - but true to Alice Walker's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so I am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out.
<br /><br />The cinematography was amazing - the African scenes live much to be desired - the African part in the book is supposed to be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of Africa outside of the Safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary Zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none West Africa ---- and most of all why get the people to speak Swahili --- who in West Africa speaks Swahili??

I am not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc.<br /><br />Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr.
are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport.
The plot was believable, and I love the message.
William Dear and the guys put together a great movie.<br /><br />Most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and they often do not work well.
But this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale, even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there.<br /><br />10/10"
2689_9	"This is a warm, funny film, in much the same vein as the works of Almodovar.
Sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that I can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted (but would I be willing to let my 10-year old son play the part? Not so sure!).
<br /><br />Spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink.
I think that we if we northern European types had the same attitude, we'd be much better off as a result.<br /><br />This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'Fartman Maurice' character.
As his lover says to him: 'Most people are embarrassed about farting.
You turn it into an art form.'"
8355_7	"The movie has a distinct (albeit brutish and rough) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy/lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they're at their most thuggish (like terrorizing the woman on the train), a semi-pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away (Dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby).
Blier cuts away from the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere, so we're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way, that incident is the start of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay, although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want).
The movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes, making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots, some of them are bound to hit."

1497_8	This film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho).
It's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast.
The movie should also be required viewing for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!
830_10	"I didn't have many expectation going into the film, but I thought it was fantastic.
Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role.
He has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor.
Pierce and Greg Kinnear play off each other great, and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time.
The humor is dark, the performances by Brosnan, Kinnear, and Hope Davis are great, mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship, and you have a great film.
This is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time.
This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career."
948_10	"This is simply one of the finest renditions of Dicken's classic tale.
The script very accurately follows the story originally penned by Dickens, and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere.
Viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice.<br /><br />George C.
Scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts.
I found that he was able to win me over to the point where I sympathized with the old miser, something rarely done in other versions.
The superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas Carol versions I have seen."
8111_8	"Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress.
It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals.<br /><br />Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema.
There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater.
However, there are some profound words there.
Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects.
Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive.
For the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors.
It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema.
They are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring.
Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth.
There is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today.
These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists."

3336_7	"I have to admit that I went into Fever Pitch with low expectations.
It's no huge revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's last movie (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me.
I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review...<br /><br />\I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was strike one in his movie career.
Well, now we've got steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! One more strike, and it's back to SNL!\"" or \""Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but don't buy tickets to Fever Pitch.
You'll walk out of the theater and never go back!\"" Then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than I was expecting.
But hey, I couldn't let my puns go to waste, right? Another reason I thought I wouldn't care for the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox.
My whole family hates 'em.
The mere mention of Pedro Martinez' name sends me running to the bathroom.
Oh man, hold on...<br /><br />...All right, I'm back.
Anyway, my mom, who is a St.
Louis Cardinals fan, still believes the World Series was rigged last year.
She refuses to believe the Sox won it legitimately.
But I'm man enough to admit that Fever Pitch caused me to sympathize, albeit only slightly, with the plight of Red Sox fans.<br /><br />Anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level.
Unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as Fallon's Ben can go through.
There's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate.
Well, figuratively speaking.
It's the joy of being a sports fan.
\""Wait 'til next year,\"" becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures that essence.<br /><br />I love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real-life backdrop of the Red Sox' improbable World Series run last year.
I don't love it so much that I want to marry it, but you know what I mean.
I expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner, and while some of the humor is a little silly, it's actually pretty realistic.<br /><br />You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died he left Ben his two season tickets.
Ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years.
At the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him.
He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals (sorry Mr.
Shade) and the Devil Rays.
It's a very good scene, and it works so well because I actually know of people who do the \""ticket draft day.\"" I also must admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents.
The Red Sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV Ben decides to tape it.
One of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result.
Been there.
It's a very tense and scary situation.
Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game.
Ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome.
Lindsey is embarrassed, and her parents don't know what to think.
Yeah, sports fans can be weird, I don't deny it.
But it's real.<br /><br />Now if you're expecting the crude, edgy stuff that the Farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed.
They do have their moments though, like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth \""like an adorable stroke victim,\"" but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side that the bros are putting on display.<br /><br />That's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy.
Thankfully, when the sap starts to ooze a bit, the Farrellys know when to pull away.
A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the field and running over to Ben to declare her undying love for him turns into Ben sincerely replying, \""You've gotta tell me about the outfield.
Is it spongy?\"" Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm.
Fever Pitch is just good, solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre.
It's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to.
Particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with 'em.<br /><br />Now if the Red Sox fans could please shut up about the \""Curse of the Bambino\"" I would appreciate it.
My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my plight greater than yours.<br /><br />THE GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, the Red Sox, baseball, or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving Fever Pitch a look.

Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people.
You know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.<br /><br />All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins (\""Emily Posa\"") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.<br /><br />This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film.
In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story.
It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots.
He looks like he's lost weight and is sick.
Smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.<br /><br />Like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits."""

8239_10	"In the immortal \Shaun of the Dead\"", we are introduced to a London where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating, reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family.
At the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour.
\""Fido\"" presents us with an epilogue to \""Shaun\"" set in 1950's America, in a hilariously witty and original \""what-if...?\"" movie.<br /><br />The film is set post-zombie-apocalypse, for a change; after the terrors of the Zombie Wars, ended by the creation of the ZomCon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs.
Every town in the world is fenced off from the Wild Zone, the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars.
The idyllic town of Willard is your typical, pristine 50's suburbia, with one small difference; social status is measured by a family's amount of domesticated zombies.
Unfortunately, the Robinson family has no zombies whatsoever, due to their patriarch, Bill's, fear of the reanimated dead.
Timmy Robinson and his mother Helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life, until the day that Helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours.<br /><br />The zombie earns Timmy's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies, and the two form a bond to rival the classic \""boy-and-his-dog\"" cliché...
a boy and his zombie.
Timmy names his \""pet\"" Fido, and he soon becomes an aid for both Timmy and Helen to escape the prison-like routine Bill has put them in.
But when Fido's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly Mrs Henderson, the Robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved Fido.<br /><br />A film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast (including \""The Matrix\""'s Carrie-Anne Moss as Helen Robinson and Billy Connelly as Fido), \""Fido\"" is a zom-com for the ages.
With some rather twisted subplots - for example, the sweet and unsettling feelings that Helen and Fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50's suburbia and the zombie genre, the film manages to bring out the worst (and the best) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them.<br /><br />\""Fido\"" is, by far, one of the best dark comedies I've ever seen, one of the best films that I've seen in a long time, and THE best zom-com since the incredible \""Shaun of the Dead\""."""

I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill.
The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is).
From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right.
All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old \sparkle\"", however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right.
She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey.
Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away.
All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school.
Because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic"""

It is very clean you can see it with family.
Very nicely done.
Songs are OK too.
I think the writer director is great.
The movie shows how marriages progress thru time.
They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story.
Some of the dialogs are quite good.
The movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization.
Also shows perfect is after all not so perfect.
Shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new.
The movie is very well written and directed.
5269_10	"I love bad movies.
Not only, because they often are as entertaining as 'really' 'good' films (like Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they often are far better than those films.
And that's the reason why I love Italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s.
And that's the reason why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & the Company.<br /><br />Director Ruggero Deodato has made some actually very good movies, like House on the Edge of the Park, and also his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man are enjoyable action movies.
But this is really bad.
The Barbarians is so idiotic movie.
Peter and David Paul as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and acting skills.
But if they can't act, they yell and scream every time they do something important.
In one scene people try to hang the Barbarian Brothers, and they escape very extraordinary way.<br /><br />Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, actually everything is bad in this movie.
I can't describe how much I laughed when I watched this first time.
The Barbarians & the Company is camp classic everybody should see once.
If you thought Plan 9 From Outer Space is fun camp, this will be a real killer."
2918_9	"...I saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as I was a big wrestling fan since 1986.
I saw this on VHS in a 'for sale' bin and bought it.<br /><br />In 1998, I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that wouldn't understand us, the travel, the heartbreak, etc.
).
Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively.
A great way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days at the time.
Plus, look at the cast...William Daniels ( Knight Rider ), Polly Holiday ( Alice ), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr.

It was on TV last night and I believe I hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and I'm now in my 4th year of college.
Although the film has many flaws, it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down, watch it, and enjoy yourself.
It is also hilarious.
Danny Glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time.
It adds to the film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted.
You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best.

5993_8	The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood.
Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story.
The use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story.
The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time.
The ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result.
I was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense.
The close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye.
The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot.
The tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do.

4008_9	"It's hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as 'Notting Hill' pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this, but well, here's the evidence and it's quite compelling.
Several have alluded to TV drama, and yes, this does have a seventies Play for Today feel at times, but is always a cut above, mainly I think owing to some quite superlative acting from Anne Reid and to a fine script which shadow-boxes with cliché without ever getting one on the nose, except maybe right at the end.
(I didn't like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway, nor the oh-what-a-beautiful-morning final scene: she deserved a more studied finale than that I think, after all that hard work.
The slippers business was a bit OTT too, on reflection).<br /><br />What I mean about avoiding cliché: well, I for one had a sinking expectation that the \mature\"" man May's daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore, so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive, virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with.
Instead, we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely, clumsy, not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow, who nevertheless doesn't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman.
It was around that point I started to sit up and pay more attention.
Here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts.
Almost Mike Leigh in that respect (minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for).<br /><br />And of course I was, as everyone probably was, dumbfounded by what Anne Reid does with her character and with her body.
She's /not/ \""the repressed, dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time\"", this is far too simplistic for the character we have.
Again and again there are allusions to her having been a \""bad housewife\"", not to mention that thing she does with trays, trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward.
The daughter accuses her of having \""sat in front of the TV all day\"" instead of, well, whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been: she has no answer.
She never was a model wife and mother, at least not to herself - that's where a lot of the poignancy comes from, the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasn't good at, ever."""

I spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor.
Such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on-air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent.
Most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama! Possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out-of-script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance.<br /><br />Since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on TV.

It is a second home to me and I can't help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city.
This is the real deal, in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them.
I am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day.
It is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was.<br /><br />Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way."
4243_8	"Gordon Parks, the prolific black Life magazine photographer, made a true ticking-timebomb of a movie here - one that does not mess around! Based upon the true story of two NYC cops - later dubbed Batman and Robin - who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs, this is a cop-buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula.
Lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here.<br /><br />Man, early '70s NYC must have been a terrible place to be a police officer, from the looks of movies like this and \Serpico.\"" These two cops start out as safety-division rookies, busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time.
But instead of receiving applause from the city police department, they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers.
They have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption, boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets, ruthless drug kingpins, and a nasty ghetto neighborhood.<br /><br />Both David Selby and Ron Leibman are fantastic in the leads; part of the entertainment is watching Leibman's eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance, and Selby's acting is low-key and wry.
These two make all the comedy aspects of the story work - displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination.
Director Parks, who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography, does not shy away from the grittiness of the story.
Rather, the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit.
Adding to this realism is the fact that the real Hantz and Greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film, and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists.
It is a real tribute to the effectiveness of Parks' direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy.<br /><br />Why has MGM/UA let this sit on the shelf for 30 years - barely giving it a home video or DVD release in the U.S? It is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s."""
11247_8	"I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out.
It blew my little head away, I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I'd heard, having been a strictly folky, classical kid growing up.
The music mesmerized me, as did Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels' tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart.
But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's drugged out sax player.
He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic, he just begged for sympathy.
Favorite scenes, the performance when the lights went out, and the love scene on the train.<br /><br />Okay, so the movie isn't the Rose! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80's, exploding with rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the dole queue.
I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there.<br /><br />If you get a chance to, see it.

8455_10	"While being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the Gundam Wing series, upon re-watching the series, I have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, character design, and character depth are masterfully executed.
While at first appearing like a boy band of sorts, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art, with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters.
Consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character.
Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality.
While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits, which, to say the least, is excellent."

<br /><br />These were the times when Marc was hobnobbing with the likes of Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who directed it] and you can even find a brief spot from one Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] bashing the ivories in an amazing [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution.
<br /><br />There's also wonderful scenes featuring Chelita Secunda [said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of glitter etc], Mickey Finn and even the actor from Catweazle!!<br /><br />The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining table, sits down cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as Get It On and The Slider.

Some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality.
This film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film.
It was never meant to be 'real' or serious.
It was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion...I was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, loved it.
SpaceCamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun.
All the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film.
So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality.

1974_8	"I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy.
No one cared when the Golden Girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving I guess is just too much for some to handle.
Let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul.
As such, it never claims to be either.
It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate.
It's the character of Catherine Trammell that helped give way for this sequel.
Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.<br /><br />The cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to Britian for sure.
The score is amazing as well.<br /><br />Sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from David Morrissey who's virtually unknown.<br /><br />There's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop.
As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.<br /><br />At the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions.
So if you've got beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?"
1813_8	"In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it I found more than I expected.
I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after I finished.
It talks about death, vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face, even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid-point of the film.
That's what makes this movie so good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth (director), to play with the people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time.
That, and the fact that it has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy ending you have to say \I have something in my eye\"" to hide the others that you cried.
All I've said are just only some of the good points of this movie.
As for the rest, you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest.
Don Bluth, thank you."""
4432_10	"I happily admit that I'm a sucker for a beautiful film, and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film.
Not one the length of Gojoe though, even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography I've seen since the Korean period piece MUSA.
However, Gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images (as does MUSA...
don't which to imply a contrast) - it's second greatest strength is superb acting, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy.
I must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end, but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way.
Vague ones, but definitely thoughts :p<br /><br />One department in which the film could have been better is the action.
There's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground.
It does create some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves, something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone.<br /><br />Still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films I've seen for quite some time.

7315_10	"Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.<br /><br />Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.
<br /><br />Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy.
Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong.
Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score.
In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!<br /><br />The cast is excellent.
Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films.
The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again.
Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, Castle, and others are good too.<br /><br />So like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill.
It is a MUST for all genre fans!<br /><br />**** out of ****"
4821_10	"One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in, it ends much to soon! Than were left looking at the screen like, \No they didn't!\"", lol.
Good performances all around! The acting is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew she would give a solid, convincing performance catching young Victoria's regality, temper, and vulnerability through out the entire movie.
Also, the production is outstanding in every way: style, substance and sensitivity.
A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen, later marrying Prince Albert, than ending with the birth of their first of nine children.
It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing.
Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen's attention, than securing her love, before Lord Melbourne(Paul Bettany), was engrossing to watch.
Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother, which was fury at times, as with her mother and King William (whom also disliked her mother).
The acting and scenes were captivating, highly emotional.
<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era, and indeed, anyone who loves a compelling true romance story"""
9033_9	"I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000).
Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship.
In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town.
Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film.
Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999).
Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).<br /><br />"

Though tame by today's standards, the special effects of \Forbidden Planet\"" were quite striking for their time.
Even today, they still hold plausibility.
Yet, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal.
Much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience.
(What did the Krell creatures look like?) By having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end, the tension and suspense held throughout the movie.
The ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying.
In my mind, this is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi films ever made."""

When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked.
We Americans are suckers for a comeback kid.<br /><br />I understand this movie was a huge draw in Sweden.
As a very provincial American I can only speculate on the reason.
Perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the Lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which I believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies.<br /><br />The message of this movie for me is the same as the movie Titanic.
Life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got.
It can be taken away at any time.
So isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt? Tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls.
Feeling alive is worth taking the risk.
Give and you will receive.
So start living NOW.<br /><br />Many people are criticizing this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws.
I say you are all pseudo-sophisticated.
Get a grip folks, it's a parable, a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty.<br /><br />So join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you.
Spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man.

6008_7	"When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s, I was in awe of this film.
Visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in Europe and USA made you relate with what Antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up in your mind the \tyrannical\"" establishments and big business interests.
The repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert, the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water, painting a plane in psychedelic designs (even the staid British Airways did it a few years ago) are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades.
Even Pink Floyd increased their fan following after the film was released.<br /><br />You see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal.
Today anti-establishment films have more substance--facts, documentation, fine performances, and superb screenplays.
Antonioni seems to be out-of-date; a flawed genius.
Even viewing Antonioni's \""Blow Up\"" today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe.<br /><br />\""Zabriski Point\"" has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released.
It was a great film if you were to see it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed TV screens.
The visual and aural (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) allure of the film still remains.
The lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural.
One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in USA extending the reality of the non-conformist values he personified in the film.<br /><br />Today, Antonioni seems out of \""sync.\"" But watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors--Rod Taylor, G.D.
Spradling, the ladies at the swimming pool, the cops at the air-strip.
The real sounds in contrast are from the non-conformists.
Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today.

10024_9	"There's so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin.
En la mente del asesino (Inside the killer's mind), that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning.
Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really, really great done.
It´s made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 milimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks.
Aro Tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa, which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering, did he really ever existed? The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people.
An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced.
The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death.
Nowadays, some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character.
The one we are witness of -the movie.<br /><br />For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aro´s mind, mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done.
Nevertheless, the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions, we clearly never justify them.
So, the first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new force (even tough never got weak or boring).<br /><br />I don't mean -and don't want- to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy."

<br /><br />Tatou's gamine-ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures, and because she's part of a large, multi-ethnic ensemble, so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters, especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me, and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that I wasn't sure if they were doing that or not.

9436_10	"\It's all up to you, Ed?\"" \""Now you get to play the game.\"" The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood.
I was but fourteen years old.
I wasn't even entirely sure what I was seeing, but I will never forgot it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty.<br /><br />Watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.<br /><br />My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.'
I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this: \""Grand Prix\"" and \""The Song of Norway.\"" Well this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch.
After leaving the theater, I was shell-shocked.<br /><br />But even at that tender age, I appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am I surprised I was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.<br /><br />Suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend.
I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.<br /><br />As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job.
The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks.
The photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.<br /><br />The moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released.
And the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering.
These four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.<br /><br />It's a classic to be sure.
And the phrase \""you have a pretty mouth\"" has been quoted endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as \""Make my day\"" or \""I'll be back\"" ever were.
<br /><br />So what would YOU do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? And if you took the measures Burt Reynolds did (and I would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance delivers.
You can take that to the bank.
If this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.<br /><br />Even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film remains the same: Ed failing to kill the deer...then changing.
Life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man.
And I suppose that's what this film is all about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives the best performance here.
And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D.
Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level.
Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed.
I guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.<br /><br />Briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today.

7063_8	"Deanna Durbin, then 14 and just under contract to MGM, made a short feature in 1936 which paired her with Judy Garland, a year younger, in the first film for both of them.
Louis B.
Mayer then decided he didn't need two competing young singers, placed his bet on Garland and let Durbin go.
Universal immediately signed Durbin, rushed her into Three Smart Girls and rewrote the screenplay to pump up her part.
She's billed last, but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name.
Universal was convinced Durbin would be a smash, and they were right.
Three Smart Girls is less a musical and more a screwball comedy, and Durbin, 15 when the movie was released, carries it with aplomb.
She's Penny Craig, and she and her older sisters, Joan and Kay, are determined to save their father, who had divorced their mother, from the clutches of an elegant gold digger with a fierce mother.
They talk their way from Switzerland, where they live, to New York City, where their father lives.
They plan not just to break up their father's wedding but to reunite their father with their mother, who after ten years apart still loves the guy.
Is there any doubt that Durbin will sing a song or two in her warm, luscious soprano? Nope.
Is there any doubt the girls will succeed...with Kay and Joan finding love and matrimonial material along the way? Nope, again.
Years later Durbin was quoted as saying that she couldn't keep playing little Miss Fixit forever.
She was right, of course, but in Three Smart Girls, her first feature movie, she has little Miss Fixit down pat.
Durbin is funny, determined, resourceful, energetic and, of all things, natural.
Her personality is so genuine that it makes this comedy -- a mix of farce, confusion, good intentions and cheerful avarice -- downright endearing.
<br /><br />Durbin carries the movie with ease.
It's a lot of fun watching her hold her own against the likes of Binnie Barnes as Donna Lyon, the woman with her hooks in Penny's rich father, played by Charles Winninger, who was no slouch at stealing scenes, either.
Alice Brady, who played the dithering matron in My Man Godfrey, plays Donna Lyons' mother, who is even more of a gold digger than her daughter.
The last of the accomplished farceurs is Ray Milland as Lord Michael Stuart, who through a contrived and amusing mix-up is mistaken for Mischa Auer.
<br /><br />Three Smart Girls holds up well as a light-weight and amusing comedy of manners and mix- ups.
So does Deanna Durbin as a brand-new star, who with her huge success saved Universal's bacon."

<br /><br />Guys and Dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is: an MGM musical.
<br /><br />Still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th Century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come.<br /><br />Warmly recommended."

Due to this, he has spent most of his life ostracized.
Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him.
The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part: his left foot.
He uses that appendage to paint and write poetry, bringing him to prominence.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration, and also on a later collaboration: \""In the Name of the Father\"" (but \""The Boxer\"" was unnecessary).
\""My Left Foot\"" can make you feel many ways: sad, hopeful, or something else.

3771_10	"1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY.
Out of the two, I've always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better.
TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the better made, but there's just nothing like Bill and Ted.
Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than Bill and Ted.
They are one of a kind.<br /><br />Seemingly influenced by National Lampoon's O.C.
and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in L.A.
back in the 1980s.
The two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born.
The film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, became a big box office success and an instant cult classic.
It wasn't long before work began on the sequel.
Stephen Herek, the director of 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' wasn't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean-spirited and unlike the first one so Peter Hewitt, making his feature film debut, was brought in to direct the sequel.
There couldn't have been a better director for the job.
BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is marvelously directed.
It's filled with its own unique style and energy that can't be matched.<br /><br />What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original, it is just as fun.
It doesn't change the characters like most sequels do.
Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film.
This is because it was written by the original writers.
Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one, but since 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same screenwriters, it ended up being just as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' if not even better.
Just like the first one, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun, and above all, original.
It's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves, and William Sadler.
It's an unforgettable 'journey'.

489_7	"Walking home after the film, I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to.
I've heard that before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's \Eyes Wide Shut\"" (track 2), 'got it just as I arrived at the door.
It's \""Waltz No.
2 from Jazz Suite No.
2\"" composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.
Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower's.
What a treat! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz.
It's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score.
Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of \""Nuovo cinema Paradiso\""), Georges Delerue, and John Barry.
There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp.
<br /><br />Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance.
The love story, their intimate connection, is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both.
Director Marleen Gorris of \""Antonia's Line\"" (1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect.
The front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess.
Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's.
Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border.<br /><br />I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies.
Alexandre Desplat's lyrical film score of \""The Luzhin Defence\"" is complete."""
12457_8	"Short synopsis <br /><br />This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men.
One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses.
Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays.
Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival (during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids, so it is really serious).
With exposed, well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women.
One gets caught, the other remains free and is not given away by his companion.
A last encounter, a last light for a cigarette, adieu l'ami, farewell, friend.<br /><br />I found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters, played by classical he-man superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson.
They are obviously attracted to each other, their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout.
The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow, a little like Deliverance.
It is also very stylish.
The safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower.
It is the seat of a publicity firm, so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around.
The wardrobe is also very good.
The ultra stylish Citroen DS (maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times) features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement.<br /><br />I can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone.
Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing, in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting.
Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics.
I have never seen Bronson better than here, he really acts - and speaks French throughout, with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed.
And it is certainly the man himself we hear.
(So the French language version is highly recommended).
The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors, Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackman's partner in French Connection II.
He is the best brainy police inspector I know.
Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ingénue who, as it turns out, is not so Innocent as it first seems.<br /><br />Anyone who expects the old in-an-out\ of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film.
For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience, full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks, although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake."""
986_10	"If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),\Date From Hell\"",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars.
Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), \""Hack\"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals.
There is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard.
Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture."""
733_9	"How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead.
It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever.
I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration.
It's extremely silly stuff, but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building).
Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society.
It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers.
Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously.
Just go in and have a good time.

I have used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet to believe it, though).<br /><br />This movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability.
Steven Oliver was perfect for the part of Dugan, so much so that he was in 1978's \""Malibu Beach\"" as the same character (not nearly as much screen time, though).<br /><br />\""Nobody calls Dugan a turd!\"" is another line for the ages.

7920_7	"Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly<br /><br />Tony (Arkin) is your average ordinary high school guy.
Prepping for the big homecoming game, girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange placesyou know the usual.
But the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs.
Now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf how will Adam get any girls?<br /><br />'Full Moon High' is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof.
Larry Cohen (Q the Winged Serpent, The Stuff) incorporates as many gags as he can possibly come up with as writer / director.
Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 Years Later) shows nice timing in the lead role.
If you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies' I think you'll have fun with this chuckle-fest."

I struggled through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see.
Fortunately, it really warmed up, and I loved the movie quite a bit.
The second half of the movie had me grinning and laughing the entire time.
Thankfully, although there were bits of CGI included, they were not overdone or prevalent.<br /><br />I would have to say, though - the actors all have heavy European accents, so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor.<br /><br />I really loved this movie, and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection."
12390_8	"Bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later of TV's \Flamingo Road\"") as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the Gateway to Hell! The scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's pal, but when Raines moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start cooking.
The neighbors, including a fantastically wicked Burgess Meredith and kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a diabolical lot, and Eli Wallach is great fun as a wily police detective.
The movie is nearly a cross-pollination of \""Rosemary's Baby\"" and \""The Exorcist\""--but what a combination! Based on the best-seller by Jeffrey Konvitz, \""The Sentinel\"" is entertainingly spooky, full of shocks brought off well by director Michael Winner, who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill.

1810_7	"I can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people don't.
For me, though, I really like it, even if I noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bits.
The animation was actually excellent, like Charlie's dream.
The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi.(I was physically ill when I read what happened to her) Also, Carface is a very convincing villain,especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback(I particularly loved \Morons I'm surrounded by Morons\"") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains.
Charlie and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song.
Some of the film is very haunting, like Annabelle's \""You can never come come back\"", which kind of scares me still.
Unfortunately, there were some bits I didn't like so much.
The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem.
Also there were some dark scenes, that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very poignant.
However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung.
None of them in particular stick out, with exception of \""Let's Make Music Together\"" and \""Love Survives\"", and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing.
All in all, a watchable movie, that could have been more, but is definitely memorable, and I would definitely watch it again.
7/10.

8266_10	"This, the finest achievement from Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Social Realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at Courrieres in northern France took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks, eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities.
Estimable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy, providing a perception of reality, augmented by matchless sound editing, with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director's fascinating visual compositions.
Pabst's manner of \invisible editing\"" that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles, enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting.
Although the work's cardinal theme relates to Socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details, born of Pabst's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for German rescue squads of whom their Fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of French victims; certainly, a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release."""

4_8	"FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway).
Though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution.
The story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate.
On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America.<br /><br />The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the U.S.
and Europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it.
Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).<br /><br />This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget.
And it just might change the way you see the world..."
9038_8	"I loved October Sky.
The thing I loved most had to be the music.
It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame.
This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties.
In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over.
The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast.
Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me.
He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself."

1072_10	"i would like to comment the series as a great effort.
The story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well, especially in season 1.
Season 2 however became more of a freak show, and lost DA's original charm.
Season one story line was more interesting, a light side to the life at Jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the X-series.
i was looking forward to new seasons, in fact i still am.
I hope the FOX guys and DA production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for DA to make a comeback.
Even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled, DA can make it big if worked on properly, and i think a name like James Cameron should take on this challenge."
1019_10	"On Sunday July 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called \Stargate SG-1\"" was broadcast on Showtime.
A spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film \""Stargate\"" starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film.
For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG-1.
Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neill (two \""l\""s!), Michael Shanks as Dr.
Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Teal'c and Don S.
Davis as Major General George S.
Hammond.
For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goa'uld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors.
At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tok'ra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan.
They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them.
And sometimes not even then.<br /><br />As with all long-running series, they were numerous cast changes.
Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor.
Daniel Jackson's successor as the team's resident archaeologist/geek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec.
However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time.
Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards.
Don S.
Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go.
The show's original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons.
His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons.
He finally left \""SG-1\"" in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter.
Jack O'Neill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.<br /><br />The ninth season represented a new era for the programme.
With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goa'uld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.
Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goa'uld as the series' main adversaries.
Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention.
Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt.
Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1.
His \""Farscape\"" co-star, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goa'uld host and con artist from another planet.
A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season.
Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack O'Neill and General Hammond.
For the last two years, they starred alongside the \""SG-1\"" faithful (Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge) and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.<br /><br />Alas, all good things must come to an end.
During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006.
After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over.
On March 13, 2007, what began with \""Children of the Gods\"" ended with \""Unending\"".
The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.<br /><br />In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, \""Star Trek\"", in terms of popularity in certain countries.
It became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world, second only to \""Doctor Who\"" (1963-1989), and the longest-running American produced sci-fi series, having surpassed \""The X-Files\"" only a few months before it ended.<br /><br />\""Stargate SG-1\"" represents the cornerstone of the \""Stargate\"" franchise.
In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled \""Stargate Atlantis\"", which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008.
Although plans for another feature film fell through, two direct-to-DVD films, \""Stargate: The Ark of Truth\"" and \""Stargate Continuum\"", were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future.
A third live-action series, \""Stargate Universe\"", is also due to premiere at some point next year.
(There was, unfortunately, an animated series, \""Stargate Infinity\"", which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better).
Despite the end of \""SG-1\"" and \""Atlantis\"" as continuing series, the future of \""Stargate\"" looks very bright indeed.<br /><br />In conclusion, while \""Stargate\"" has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as \""Star Trek\"" and \""Doctor Who\"", its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come."""
58_9	"Caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels, and was so intrigued I sought out the next showing.<br /><br />I really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed.
It also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's, a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days.<br /><br />The fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot.
To see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming.
And will admit that I shed quite a few tears throughout.<br /><br />On the whole, not a movie that I would seek out to what, however I am sure glad I did see it."
2719_10	"I saw this film after watching Capote and Infamous.
It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie.
The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay.<br /><br />The film starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer/director Brooks creates.<br /><br />Notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to-be-killed are linked.
Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to Perry on the phone.
Cutter washing his face is matched-cut to Perry washing his face.
Only Perry's looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty chairs.
This failure/fantasy matches the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty.<br /><br />Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die.
we cut to the Clutters.<br /><br />Perry talks his dream about a yellow bird, \Taller than Jesus\"" who attacks the Nuns who have persecuted them.
\""The Nuns begged for mercy,\"" he tells us, \""But the bird slaughtered them anyway.\"" The bird lifted Perry to paradise.
Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion.
This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom.<br /><br />The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs.<br /><br />Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house.
She is holding a horse.
Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on.
Nancy can't sleep over at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner.
The decision seals her fate.<br /><br />Perry talks of Bogart in \""Treasure of Sierra Madre\"".
But it is another Bogart picture, \""Beat the Devil\"" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin.
But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing.
Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, (which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure.<br /><br />Cut to Herb Clutter signing a $40,000 life insurance policy.
He's thinking about mortality at the moment.
Ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours.
The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours.<br /><br />Dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them.
Later, in fact, it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were remembered.<br /><br />\""There was one witness,\"" the detective keeps telling Dick later.
But was that witness the jail-house friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? The viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie.<br /><br />Fascinating film."""
6936_7	"Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII.
Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction.
Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner.
This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time.
Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull.
Thank God, with in a few years, we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films.
The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona.
I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but it gets an above average recommendation from me.<br /><br />."
7966_9	"As a kid I thought this movie was great.
It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: Michael J.
Fox.
Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons.
It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera.
It has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry.
Even when people hum it.
And it has my favorite actor, Michael J.
Fox.
<br /><br />Based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance.
The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away.
Dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives.
A truly incredible journey.
So what, maybe home IS just over that mountain.
But what if it isn't? <br /><br />I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that ...
yeah, everyone go watch it."
2319_8	"<br /><br />It's a generic coming-of-age story -- think \The Member of the Wedding,\"" \""Summer of '42,\"" \""A Summer Place,\"" even \""Little Women\"" -- and there are moments where Mulligan might have omitted the soupy music, not used slow-motion, or played down the golden-lit prettiness of the setting.
Otherwise, it's done with rare emotional perfect-pitch.
Nothing's forced, every line has feeling, and the pacing is just right.
Even the below-A-list casting helps: Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material.
In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: Her line readings are fresh and original, and her body language is just right for a gawky, hoydenish 14-year-old on the eve of womanhood.
Waterston is also very fine, even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck.<br /><br />One senses that the film's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects -- no big stars, no big car crashes, no special effects -- and consciously decided to make the best possible movie, box office be damned.
It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs.
If you find yourself misting up at the end, you don't have to feel you've been duped."""
2027_10	"What can be said of the compelling performance of Tara Fitzgerald? She is utterly believable as the injured Mrs Graham, hardened by experience, sharp and strong-willed, yet not immune to the passionate attentions of Mr Markham.
Through every mischievous glance and every flare of temper, every flicker of discernment in his eyes and telling facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character.
He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen's injured spirit.
Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue.
Yet despite all he has done, there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end; he is at least aware of his own failings and how they have brought his ruin.
Helen's attempt to save his soul-- after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of--is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the worth of every human life and soul, however misguided, however sinful that person may be.
Markham's constancy may then be seen as her reward for her faith and unyielding moral character.
Though the opinionated ideas of morality so strongly presented in Tenant seem outdated by today's standards, the story is imbued with integrity, passion, and conviction which still make an impact.
Tenant is far more believable than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that does the novel justice.
I highly recommend viewing it!"
1965_7	"I found this movie to be very good in all areas.
The acting was brilliant from all characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey.
Tramell's Character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute.

The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece.

10605_7	This film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast.
David Strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and Danny Vinson plays a perfect pussy-whipped southern husband.

1980_10	"One of the last great musicals of the 60s.
I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite since then.
The musical numbers are all memorable.
In the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a CERTAIN Academy Award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city).
All of the main roles were beautifully cast...Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy.
Oliver Reed was a menacing Bill Sikes (who thankfully has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as the Dodger were great too.

12170_8	"Romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? You'll see one that's really sappy, and you'll think you want something more realistic.
Then, you'll see one that's realistic, but it might be too dull to keep you interested.
Or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but just fails to make you smile.
Romantic comedies are tough movies.
You go into them with a lot of expectations, and usually, whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you.<br /><br />Of course, if you've got a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good, you've got other things on your mind.
For you, I say, \Go get her, Tiger!\"" For the rest of us, I say, \""See _A Guy Thing_.\"" It's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're going in to this movie with expectations, so it doesn't pretend that its \""Guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams, and it's not his wife!\"" plot is going to make everyone happy.
Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel.
_A Guy Thing_ covers that.
What _A Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast I've seen in a long time, so if you don't the main plotline, you've still got something to make you smile.
<br /><br />Whether we're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen, like Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!),
 David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty), or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation, steal the show,
 time after time, and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days.
<br /><br />And that's not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along, because it's very sweet and terribly well done.
Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control, and Selma Blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is.<br /><br />A lot of the success of the movie, though, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she wears it well.
Not since, gosh, I don't know when, have I seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy.
Of course, it's all in the closeups, the voice, and the subtle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place.<br /><br />But Julie Stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity.
This is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types, makes them fall over each other to make you laugh, and then comes through with a great deal of heart.<br /><br />A Guy Thing is a movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it.
We haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since Shakespeare; the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl.
A Guy Thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge, often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play.<br /><br />For the record, it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it.<br /><br />And guys, I think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie.
I'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema, I suggest you just say \""It's a Guy Thing,\"" and leave it at that."""
8534_10	"Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia, a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident.
While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick, fast-talking, charming womanizer Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and boorish, surly, racist biker Bloss (a terrific William Forsythe), who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with.
Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married girlfriend Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt).
But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own.<br /><br />This remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through.
Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste, wit and warmth, specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle, including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room).
Besides the expected poignancy, the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw, earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club.
The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding, with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss' doting, amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses.
Despite the grim subject matter, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit.
A simply wonderful little gem of a drama."

<br /><br />Even tho he didn't say those words, I still think he would! I've never forgotten 'Are ye carrying?' in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: 'Always have money in thine pocket!' Good advice.
<br /><br />Not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well-meant attitudes any more.
Or any father at all.<br /><br />It would be a good thing for us to reinstate 'thee', 'thy' and 'thine' in our language to show we care.
It is only the same as 'tutoyer' in French or 'du' in German.<br /><br />Addendum: I just realised that a lot of my remarks were about James Mason in The Family Way!<br /><br />I think it's because I mixed up Susan George with Hayley Mills.
Well, easy mistake.<br /><br />I stand by the comments tho'.<br /><br />And Spring and Port Wine is so very similar to The Family Way.<br /><br />When you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days, you really had something to say and talk about afterwards, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development.
<br /><br />Theatrical experiences are almost real, and they are important in helping young people to grow up.<br /><br />It doesn't happen now, I think, that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did."

The essentials are a bodyguard's search and destroy mission as his charge, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent.
The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion, with plot twists along the way.
Washington, a former CIA operative with a drinking problem, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline.
Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning, the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends.
Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars."
5352_7	"This is an Arnold movie.
Now that you know that, I've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review.
If you don't like Arnold, then you wont like this movie.
If the case is the other, then you will very probably like it.
It's as simple as that.<br /><br />Now, if you're still reading this I expect you like Arnold.
Good for you! He is quite good isn't he.
The Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature.
It's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80's B-Sci Fi, it's got a bunch of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending.<br /><br />In this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows.
Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking Amber.<br /><br />It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it.
It's hopelessly 80's, but I find that charming.
Acting is varying, Arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners.
Heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man.<br /><br />In spite of all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people.
It also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience.
This does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming.<br /><br />If you've seen Arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one.
Enjoy."
8456_10	"I've watched almost all of the Gundam/Mech anime that have showed in the US and this by far has the best story.
The way its plot twists and turns has u riveted.
Gundam Wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war.
The series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as Gundams.
The Gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as Oz.
As things begin to heat up between OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate.
Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise.
To obtain peace the Gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting.
But, how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal.
I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot."
7537_10	"Contrary to what those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers as well as inspiration.
It also provides reliable news, logical commentary and a different view than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS thinks is best.
Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related commentary, those who are behind the 700 Club provide help for those in need, such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical help to those living in poverty-stricken communities and giving hope to those who need hope.
It's not at all hateful.
If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest reaching for the remote control and turning the channel on your TV set.
I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or for that matter, programs which I find biased or offensive.
What I find offensive is the way that the ABC Family inserts the disclaimer that the views of the 700 Club do not reflect those of ABC Family."
6654_7	"The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was.
His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie.
It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi.
Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son.
The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture."
12374_7	"I'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity, as despite some rather silly goings on; The Sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money.
Michael Winner has admitted many times that he's not the best director of all time, and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film; but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it's uninspired direction, and the fact that Winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it.
The plot is rich with mystery, and begins by focusing on Alison Parker and her hunt for a flat.
She finds that she can't afford most properties she looks at, but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price.
Her problems start soon after moving in, as she doesn't like her neighbours very much...and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour; an elderly blind priest on the top floor...<br /><br />The cast list is truly superb, with the relatively unknown Cristina Raines heading up a great support cast.
Chris Sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite Raines, but small parts for the likes of John Carradine, Eli Wallach, Ava Gardner, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken, to name but a handful more than make up for Sarandon's lifeless portrayal.
Michael Winner does a good job with his central location, as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story.
The film is a little slow to start, but it's never boring; and Michael Winner's screenplay provides a surprise that's almost impossible to guess from the offset, which certainly deserves some praise.
Like many similar slow-burning horrors, this one doesn't go for the money shot early on - but unlike many, the ending is a definite climax as Winner goes all out to shock the viewer, and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true; I've got to say that he does a very good job at it! Overall, while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it;
 The Sentinel is one of the better films of its type, and it's definitely a major highlight for its director."

Realism is the key here.
Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch.
How this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of Americana.

Cinematography is excellent.

Torn & Farrell excel in this movie."
10536_10	"Yes...I'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why.
In the last few years, I have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget.
Then I stumble upon \Nothing\"".
Looked interesting, wasn't expecting much though.
I was wrong.
This was probably one of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch.
Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not over complex to the point of missing the joke.
I don't want to remark on any of the actual scenes, because I do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once.
With more and more pointless concepts coming into movies (you know, like killer military jets and \""fresh\"" remakes that are ruining old classics), This movie will make you happy to say it's OK to laugh at \""Nothing\""."""
10977_8	"I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers.
The expanded Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out.
<br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore.
I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams one act.
Well worth your time."
7652_8	"The acting- fantastic.
The story- amazing.
The script- wonderful.<br /><br />Just a few ways to describe this movie.
Yes, it's slow and it has mostly talking, but the whole story of all of their lives and how it's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story.
I, myself, am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie.
I'm also to read the Exectioner's Song, which is the 'other' half of the Gilmore story.
This movie made me think so much about the phrase \piering into the other side of the looking glass\"".
You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes(which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself.
This movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others.
I recommend this movie(and the book) very very much."""
1801_8	"I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989.
I enjoyed it then, and I still do now.
But what I realize now is that this is quite \adult\"" for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven.
Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog.
There are some good songs ranging from upbeat (\""Let's Make Music Together\"") to downright emotional (\""Home to My Heart\"").
I found the plot good, although it does go off on a tangent once or twice.
The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation.

5243_9	"I sought this film out because I'm a new Frain fan and wanted to see more of his work.
First of all, his Irish accent is great.
He's got a keen ear for dialects, it seems.
His acting was marvelous, as usual.
James Frain aside, I thought the film was very well done.
It showed the conflict in Northern Ireland as the *mess* it really is.
Both sides are guilty of grave injustices, and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances.<br /><br />Also, it is interesting to realise that not every man (or woman) that is supposedly fighting for his country, is really doing *just* that.
For example, when Kenny (James Frain) asks Ginger (Ian Hart) why he does \it\"", Ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer.
Why? Because Ginger isn't in it for the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow Protestants...Ginger is in it for the fun of killing.
He's full of blood-lust and it's the perfect job for a guy like him.
In a struggle like this there are guys like Liam (John Lynch) who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their families...guys that see all of the fighting just begats more fighting.
There are guys like Kenny that are born leaders full of charisma, and they add fuel to the flames, rather they mean to or not.
Also, Kenny genuinely believes in the \""cause\"".
He believes what he is doing will make a difference in the future...which is a bit odd 'cause his character seems too intelligent for it all.
But, like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men, he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it...'til it's too late.
Then there is Ginger, a pure psycho who isn't in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it, which in a gangland type war makes him a valued asset, some might argue.
However, now, in this film, Ginger has out lasted his worth, and has become a very dangerous loose cannon.<br /><br />Everything comes to a boiling point, and predictably, the ending is a tragic one.
What makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict.
Being American, I can't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about.
But, I do know there has to be a better way.<br /><br />All in all, a well acted, touching...but troubling film."""
10932_7	"Of all the kung-fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following.
With the exception of all the films Bruce Lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story.
An aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil Yang Tieh (Sheng Chiang) about five pupils he has trained in the past.
All five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently.
Their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like Lizard, Snake, Centipede, Toad and Scorpion.
The master called them the Poison Clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants Tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil.
An old man who was once a member of the Poison Clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target.
Tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are.
Tieh has discovered that the Snake is Hung Wen Tung (Pai Wei) and along with Tang Sen Kue (Feng Lu) who is the Centipede they kill a family to find the map.
A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is.
A local policeman named Ho Yung Sin (Philip Kwok) investigates the murders along with his partner Ma Chow (Chien Sun).
Sin has a friend called Li Ho (Meng Lo) who is the Toad and they do know of each others identity.
The Snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on Li Ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed.
When Sin finds out he teams up with Tieh and together they go to combat Tung and Kue.
<br /><br />This film was directed by Cheh Chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films.
Chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them.
While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme.
Even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that.
Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks.
Then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is.
Very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of Changs stories were in a class all by themselves.
I wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as \Enter The Dragon\"" because Bruce Lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking.
This film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes.
Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved.
That alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films.
Very well made with a unique story."""
7678_10	"I just watched Holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called Trade at Film by the Sea international film festival.
I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water.
<br /><br />Holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels.
From purely an artistic and cinematic perspective, it is amazing.
The sound-mixing, camera angles, directing and acting are all spot on.
<br /><br />Additionally, the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non-exploitative.
It presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate.
The filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking.
Too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape, and violence.
Holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical Hollywood trend.
<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in Netherlands.
I can honestly say that I have never seen audiences more moved.
Just listening to conversations after the screening, people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation.
<br /><br />I highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and its subject matter."

Even when I was in 3rd grade I still watched it from time to time.
Recently, I watched it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and though the show was not aimed for my age group (I'm in my late teens), I still found it entertaining and educational.
This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others.
Some parts I found quite entertaining.
Also, this show does not have any bad content, so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot.
I would recommend this."
1453_8	"Well, there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller.
Usually they are derivative or too ambitious, often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable.
But City Hall does not do neither of the above mentioned.
The plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable.
As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average.
No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always.
His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays."

The movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider love to be.
The movie displayed what love really is, action not emotion.
